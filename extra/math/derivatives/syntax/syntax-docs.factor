HELP: DERIVATIVE:
{ $description "Defines the derivative of a word by setting its " { $snippet "derivative" } " word property.  Reads a word followed by " { $snippet "n" } " quotations, giving the " { $snippet "n" } " partial derivatives of the word with respect to each of its arguments successively.  Each quotation should take " { $snippet "n + 1" } " inputs, where the first input is an increment and the last " { $snippet "n" } " inputs are the point at which to evaluate the derivative.  The derivative should be a linear function of the increment, and should have the same number of outputs as the original word." }
