"This vocab provides words for affine transformations of 2d vectors. It can sometimes be more suitable to use the words in this vocab, than setting up the affine transformation matrices manually."

  "Creates a 45 degree counter clock-wise rotation matrix and applies it to a vector:"

    "USING: math.affine-transforms math.functions prettyprint ;\n45 deg>rad <rotation> { 0 4 } a.v ."
