HELP: successor

{ $description
    "Returns the successor to " { $snippet "str" } ". The successor is calculated by incrementing characters starting from the rightmost alphanumeric (or the rightmost character if there are no alphanumerics) in the string. Incrementing a digit always results in another digit, and incrementing a letter results in another letter of the same case. "
    $nl
    "If the increment generates a carry, the character to the left of it is incremented. This process repeats until there is no carry, adding an additional character if necessary. "
