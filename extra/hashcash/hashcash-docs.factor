  $nl
  "The decision about how long the stamp should be considered valid is up to the verifier. If it is too short, then it is possible for some applications that the stamp will expire before arriving at the recipient (e.g. with e-mail). The suggested value of 28 days should be safe for normal e-mail delivery delays. The choice is a trade-off between database size and risk of expiry prior to arrival, and depends on the application."
