"The following is a simple snippet of Factor code:"
{ $example "10 sq 5 - ." "95" }
"You can click on it to evaluate it in the listener, and it will print the same output value as indicated above."
$nl
"Factor has a very simple syntax. Your program consists of " { $emphasis "words" } " and " { $emphasis "literals" } ". In the above snippet, the words are " { $link sq } ", " { $link - } " and " { $link . } ". The two integers 10 and 5 are literals."
$nl
"Factor evaluates code left to right, and stores intermediate values on a " { $emphasis "stack" } ". If you think of the stack as a pile of papers, then " { $emphasis "pushing" } " a value on the stack corresponds to placing a piece of paper at the top of the pile, while " { $emphasis "popping" } " a value corresponds to removing the topmost piece."
$nl
"Most words have a " { $emphasis "stack effect declaration" } ", for example " { $snippet "( x y -- z )" } " denotes that a word takes two inputs, with " { $snippet "y" } " at the top of the stack, and returns one output. Stack effect declarations can be viewed by browsing source code, or using tools such as " { $link see } ". See " { $link "effect-declaration" } "."
$nl
"Coming back to the example in the beginning of this article, the following series of steps occurs as the code is evaluated:"
{ $table
    { "Action" "Stack contents" }
    { "10 is pushed on the stack." { $snippet "10" } }
    { { "The " { $link sq } " word is executed. It pops one input from the stack - the integer 10 - and squares it, pushing the result." } { $snippet "100" } }
    { { "5 is pushed on the stack." } { $snippet "100 5" } }
    { { "The " { $link - } " word is executed. It pops two inputs from the stack - the integers 100 and 5 - and subtracts 5 from 100, pushing the result." } { $snippet "95" } }
    { { "The " { $link . } " word is executed. It pops one input from the stack - the integer 95 - and prints it in the listener's output area." } { } }

ARTICLE: "cookbook-colon-defs" "Shuffle word and definition cookbook"
"The " { $link dup } " word makes a copy of the value at the top of the stack:"
{ $example "5 dup * ." "25" }
"The " { $link sq } " word is actually defined as follows:"
{ $code ": sq dup * ;" }
"(You could have looked this up yourself by clicking on the " { $link sq } " word itself.)"
$nl
"Note the key elements in a word definition: The colon " { $link POSTPONE: : } " denotes the start of a word definition. The name of the new word must immediately follow. The word definition then continues on until the " { $link POSTPONE: ; } " token signifies the end of the definition. This type of word definition is called a " { $emphasis "compound definition." }
$nl
"Factor is all about code reuse through short and logical colon definitions. Breaking up a problem into small pieces which are easy to test is called " { $emphasis "factoring." }
$nl
"Another example of a colon definition:"
{ $code ": neg ( x -- -x ) 0 swap - ;" }
"Here the " { $link swap } " shuffle word is used to interchange the top two stack elements. Note the difference that " { $link swap } " makes in the following two snippets:"
{ $code
    "5 0 -       ! Computes 5-0"
    "5 0 swap -  ! Computes 0-5"
}
"Also, in the above example a stack effect declaration is written between " { $snippet "(" } " and " { $snippet ")" } " with a mnemonic description of what the word does to the stack. See " { $link "effect-declaration" } " for details."
{ $curious
    "This syntax will be familiar to anybody who has used Forth before. However the behavior is slightly different. In most Forth systems, the below code prints 2, because the definition of " { $snippet "b" } " still refers to the previous definition of " { $snippet "a" } ":"

        ": a 1 ;"
        ": b a 1 + ;"

$nl
"Another useful form of control flow is iteration. You can do something several times:"
{ $code "10 [ \"Factor rocks!\" print ] times" }
"Now we can look at a new data type, the array:"

ARTICLE: "cookbook-philosophy" "Factor philosophy"
"Factor is a high-level language with automatic memory management, runtime type checking, and strong typing. Factor code should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. If you are coming to Factor from another programming language, one of your first observations might me related to the amount of code you " { $emphasis "don't" } " have to write."
$nl
"If you try to write Factor word definitions which are longer than a couple of lines, you will find it hard to keep track of the stack contents. Well-written Factor code is " { $emphasis "factored" } " into short definitions, where each definition is easy to test interactively, and has a clear purpose. Well-chosen word names are critical, and having a thesaurus on hand really helps."
$nl
"If you run into problems with stack shuffling, take a deep breath and a step back, and reconsider the problem. A much simpler solution is waiting right around the corner, a natural solution which requires far less stack shuffling and far less code. As a last resort, if no simple solution exists, consider defining a domain-specific language."
$nl
"Every time you define a word which simply manipulates sequences, hashtables or objects in an abstract way which is not related to your program domain, check the library to see if you can reuse an existing definition and save yourself some debugging time."
$nl
"In addition to writing short definitions and testing them interactively, a great habit to get into is writing unit tests. Factor provides good support for unit testing; see " { $link "tools.test" } "."
$nl
"Factor tries to implement as much of itself as possible, because this improves simplicity and performance. One consequence is that Factor exposes its internals for extension and study. You even have the option of using low-level features not usually found in high-level languages, such manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and inline assembly code."
$nl
"Unsafe features are tucked away so that you will not invoke them by accident, or have to use them to solve conventional programming problems. However when the need arises, unsafe features are invaluable, for example you might have to do some pointer arithmetic when interfacing directly with C libraries." ;

    { "When a source file uses two vocabularies which define words with the same name, the order of the vocabularies in the " { $link POSTPONE: USE: } " or " { $link POSTPONE: USING: } " forms is important.
