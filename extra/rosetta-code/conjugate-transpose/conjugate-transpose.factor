! Suppose that a matrix M contains complex numbers. Then the
! conjugate transpose of M is a matrix MH containing the complex
! conjugates of the matrix transposition of M.

! This means that row j, column i of the conjugate transpose
! equals the complex conjugate of row i, column j of the original
! matrix.

! In the next list, M must also be a square matrix.

! A Hermitian matrix equals its own conjugate transpose: MH = M.

! A normal matrix is commutative in multiplication with its
! conjugate transpose: MHM = MMH.

! A unitary matrix has its inverse equal to its conjugate
! transpose: MH = M âˆ’ 1. This is true iff MHM = In and iff MMH =
! In, where In is the identity matrix.

! Given some matrix of complex numbers, find its conjugate
! transpose. Also determine if it is a Hermitian matrix, normal
! matrix, or a unitary matrix.
