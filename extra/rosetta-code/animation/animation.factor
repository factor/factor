! Animation is the foundation of a great many parts of graphical
! user interfaces, including both the fancy effects when things
! change used in window managers, and of course games. The core of
! any animation system is a scheme for periodically changing the
! display while still remaining responsive to the user. This task
! demonstrates this.

! Create a window containing the string "Hello World! " (the
! trailing space is significant). Make the text appear to be
! rotating right by periodically removing one letter from the end
! of the string and attaching it to the front. When the user
! clicks on the text, it should reverse its direction.

CONSTANT: sentence "Hello World! "
