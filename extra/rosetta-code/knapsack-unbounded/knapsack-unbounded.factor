! A traveller gets diverted and has to make an unscheduled stop
! in what turns out to be Shangri La. Opting to leave, he is
! allowed to take as much as he likes of the following items, so
! long as it will fit in his knapsack, and he can carry it. He
! knows that he can carry no more than 25 'weights' in total; and
! that the capacity of his knapsack is 0.25 'cubic lengths'.

! Looking just above the bar codes on the items he finds their
! weights and volumes. He digs out his recent copy of a financial
! paper and gets the value of each item.

! He can only take whole units of any item, but there is much
! more of any item than he could ever carry

! How many of each item does he take to maximise the value of
! items he is carrying away with him?

! Note:

! There are four solutions that maximise the value taken. Only
! one need be given.
