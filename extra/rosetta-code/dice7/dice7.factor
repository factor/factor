! Given an equal-probability generator of one of the integers 1
! to 5 as dice5; create dice7 that generates a pseudo-random
! integer from 1 to 7 in equal probability using only dice5 as a
! source of random numbers, and check the distribution for at
! least 1000000 calls using the function created in Simple
! Random Distribution Checker.

! Implementation suggestion: dice7 might call dice5 twice,
! re-call if four of the 25 combinations are given, otherwise
! split the other 21 combinations into 7 groups of three, and
! return the group index from the rolls.

! http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Simple_Random_Distribution_Checker

! Create a function to check that the random integers returned
! from a small-integer generator function have uniform
! distribution.

! The function should take as arguments:

! * The function (or object) producing random integers.
! * The number of times to call the integer generator.
! * A 'delta' value of some sort that indicates how close to a
!   flat distribution is close enough.

! The function should produce:

! * Some indication of the distribution achieved.
! * An 'error' if the distribution is not flat enough.

! Show the distribution checker working when the produced
! distribution is flat enough and when it is not. (Use a
! generator from Seven-dice from Five-dice).

! Output a random integer 1..5.
