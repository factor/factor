! A tourist wants to make a good trip at the weekend with his
! friends. They will go to the mountains to see the wonders of
! nature, so he needs to pack well for the trip. He has a good
! knapsack for carrying things, but knows that he can carry a
! maximum of only 4kg in it and it will have to last the whole
! day. He creates a list of what he wants to bring for the trip
! but the total weight of all items is too much. He then decides
! to add columns to his initial list detailing their weights and a
! numerical value representing how important the item is for the
! trip.

! The tourist can choose to take any combination of items from
! the list, but only one of each item is available. He may not cut
! or diminish the items, so he can only take whole units of any
! item.

! Which items does the tourist carry in his knapsack so that
! their total weight does not exceed 400 dag [4 kg], and their
! total value is maximised?
