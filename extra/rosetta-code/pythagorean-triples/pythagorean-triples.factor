! A Pythagorean triple is defined as three positive integers
! (a,b,c) where a < b < c, and a2 + b2 = c2. They are called
! primitive triples if a,b,c are coprime, that is, if their
! pairwise greatest common divisors gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,c) = gcd(b,c)
! = 1. Because of their relationship through the Pythagorean
! theorem, a, b, and c are coprime if a and b are coprime
! (gcd(a,b) = 1). Each triple forms the length of the sides of a
! right triangle, whose perimeter is P = a + b + c.

! Task

! The task is to determine how many Pythagorean triples there
! are with a perimeter no larger than 100 and the number of these
! that are primitive.

! Extra credit: Deal with large values. Can your program handle
! a max perimeter of 1,000,000? What about 10,000,000?
! 100,000,000?

! Note: the extra credit is not for you to demonstrate how fast
! your language is compared to others; you need a proper algorithm
! to solve them in a timely manner.
