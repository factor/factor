! In object-oriented programming an object is active when its
! state depends on clock. Usually an active object encapsulates a
! task that updates the object's state. To the outer world the
! object looks like a normal object with methods that can be
! called from outside. Implementation of such methods must have a
! certain synchronization mechanism with the encapsulated task in
! order to prevent object's state corruption.

! A typical instance of an active object is an animation widget.
! The widget state changes with the time, while as an object it
! has all properties of a normal widget.

! The task

! Implement an active integrator object. The object has an input
! and output. The input can be set using the method Input. The
! input is a function of time. The output can be queried using the
! method Output. The object integrates its input over the time and
! the result becomes the object's output. So if the input is K(t)
! and the output is S, the object state S is changed to S + (K(t1)
! + K(t0)) * (t1 - t0) / 2, i.e. it integrates K using the trapeze
! method. Initially K is constant 0 and S is 0.

! In order to test the object:
! * set its input to sin (2Ï€ f t), where the frequency f=0.5Hz.
!   The phase is irrelevant.
! * wait 2s
! * set the input to constant 0
! * wait 0.5s

! Verify that now the object's output is approximately 0 (the
! sine has the period of 2s). The accuracy of the result will
! depend on the OS scheduler time slicing and the accuracy of the
! clock.
