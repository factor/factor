! Define an ordered word as a word in which the letters of the
! word appear in alphabetic order. Examples include 'abbey' and
! 'dirt'.

! The task is to find and display all the ordered words in this
! dictionary that have the longest word length. (Examples that
! access the dictionary file locally assume that you have
! downloaded this file yourself.) The display needs to be shown on
! this page.
