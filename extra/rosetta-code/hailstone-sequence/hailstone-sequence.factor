! The Hailstone sequence of numbers can be generated from a
! starting positive integer, n by:

! * If n is 1 then the sequence ends.
! * If n is even then the next n of the sequence = n/2
! * If n is odd then the next n of the sequence = (3 * n) + 1

! The (unproven), Collatz conjecture is that the hailstone
! sequence for any starting number always terminates.

! Task Description:

! 1. Create a routine to generate the hailstone sequence for a
!    number.

! 2. Use the routine to show that the hailstone sequence for the
!    number 27 has 112 elements starting with 27, 82, 41, 124 and
!    ending with 8, 4, 2, 1

! 3. Show the number less than 100,000 which has the longest
!    hailstone sequence together with that sequences length.
!    (But don't show the actual sequence)!
