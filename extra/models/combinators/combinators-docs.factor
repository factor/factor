"The " { $vocab-link "models.combinators" } " library expands models to have discrete start and end times. "
"Also, it provides methods of manipulating and combining models, expecially useful when programming user interfaces: "
"The output models of some gadgets (see " { $vocab-link "ui.gadgets.controls" } " ) can be manipulated and used as the input models of others. " ;
