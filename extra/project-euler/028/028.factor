! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a
! 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

!     21 22 23 24 25
!     20  7  8  9 10
!     19  6  1  2 11
!     18  5  4  3 12
!     17 16 15 14 13

! It can be verified that the sum of both diagonals is 101.

! What is the sum of both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?


! SOLUTION
! --------

! For a square sized n by n, the sum of corners is 4nÂ² - 6n + 6

<PRIVATE

: sum-corners ( n -- sum )
    dup 1 = [ [ sq 4 * ] [ 6 * ] bi - 6 + ] unless ;

: sum-diags ( n -- sum )
    1 swap 2 <range> [ sum-corners ] map-sum ;
