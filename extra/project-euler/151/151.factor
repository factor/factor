! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a
! sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.

! Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large
! sheet of the special paper with size A1.

! He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he
! cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he
! obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.

! All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

! At the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one
! sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is larger,
! he repeats the 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs and any
! remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.

! Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of
! times (during each week) that the foreman finds a single sheet of paper in
! the envelope.

! Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .
