! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used
! to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are
! relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less
! than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6. The number 1 is considered to
! be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.

! Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation
! of 79180.

! Find the value of n, 1 < n < 10^(7), for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and
! the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.


! SOLUTION
! --------

! For n/φ(n) to be minimised, φ(n) must be as close to n as possible; that is,
! we want to maximise φ(n). The minimal solution for n/φ(n) would be if n was
! prime giving n/(n-1) but since n-1 never is a permutation of n it cannot be
! prime.

! The next best thing would be if n only consisted of 2 prime factors close to
! (in this case) sqrt(10000000). Hence n = p1*p2 and we only need to search
! through a list of known prime pairs. In addition:

!     φ(p1*p2) = p1*p2*(1-1/p1)(1-1/p2) = (p1-1)(p2-1)

! ...so we can compute φ(n) more efficiently.
