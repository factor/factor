! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers.
! If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

! If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order
! of size, we get:

! 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3,
! 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

! It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

! How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions
! for d ≤ 1,000,000?


! SOLUTION
! --------

! The answer can be found by adding totient(n) for 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e6
