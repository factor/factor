! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

!     41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

! This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below
! one-hundred.

! The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a
! prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

! Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
! consecutive primes?


! SOLUTION
! --------

! 1) Create an sequence of all primes under 1000000.
! 2) Start summing elements in the sequence until the next number would put you
!    over 1000000.
! 3) Check if that sum is prime, if not, subtract the last number added.
! 4) Repeat step 3 until you get a prime number, and store it along with the
!    how many consecutive numbers from the original sequence it took to get there.
! 5) Drop the first number from the sequence of primes, and do steps 2-4 again
! 6) Compare the longest chain from the first run with the second run, and store
!    the longer of the two.
! 7) If the sequence of primes is still longer than the longest chain, then
!    repeat steps 5-7...otherwise, you've found the longest sum of consecutive
!    primes!
