! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up
! of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather
! interesting sub-string divisibility property.

! Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note
! the following:

!     * d2d3d4  = 406 is divisible by 2
!     * d3d4d5  = 063 is divisible by 3
!     * d4d5d6  = 635 is divisible by 5
!     * d5d6d7  = 357 is divisible by 7
!     * d6d7d8  = 572 is divisible by 11
!     * d7d8d9  = 728 is divisible by 13
!     * d8d9d10 = 289 is divisible by 17

! Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.


! SOLUTION
! --------

! Brute force generating all the pandigitals then checking 3-digit divisiblity
! properties...this is very slow!

! ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS
! -------------------

! Build the number from right to left, generating the next 3-digits according
! to the divisiblity rules and combining them with the previous digits if they
! overlap and still have all unique digits. When done with that, add whatever
! missing digit is needed to make the number pandigital.
