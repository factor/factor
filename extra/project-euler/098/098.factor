! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9,
! and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36^2. What
! is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions,
! the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96^2. We
! shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and
! specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither
! may a different letter have the same digital value as another
! letter.

! Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
! 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English
! words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic
! word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).

! What is the largest square number formed by any member of such
! a pair?

! NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text
! file.
