! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

!     n -> n / 2  (n is even)
!     n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)

! Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
! sequence:

!     13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

! It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
! contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
! is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

! Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

! NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.


! SOLUTION
! --------

! Brute force

    dup even? [ 2 / ] [ 3 * 1 + ] if ;
