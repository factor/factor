! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

!     14 = 2 * 7
!     15 = 3 * 5

! The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

!     644 = 2Â² * 7 * 23
!     645 = 3 * 5 * 43
!     646 = 2 * 17 * 19.

! Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes
! factors. What is the first of these numbers?


! SOLUTION
! --------

! Brute force, not sure why it's incredibly slow compared to other languages

! ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS
! -------------------

! Use a sieve to generate prime factor counts up to an arbitrary limit, then
! look for a repetition of the specified number of factors.

! TODO: I don't like that you have to specify the upper bound, maybe try making
! this lazy so it could also short-circuit when it finds the answer?
