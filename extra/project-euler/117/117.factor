! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen
! from: red tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three
! units, and blue tiles measuring four units, it is possible to tile a
! row measuring five units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.

! How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled?


! SOLUTION
! --------

! This solution uses a simple dynamic programming approach using the
! following recurence relation

! ways(i) = 1 | i <= 0
! ways(i) = ways(i-4) + ways(i-3) + ways(i-2) + ways(i-1)
