! DESCRIPTION
! -----------

! Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
! standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For
! example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.

! A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to
! ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The
! advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the
! cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107
! XOR 42 = 65.

! For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
! message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
! encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without
! both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

! Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
! method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
! message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
! message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password
! key for security, but short enough to be memorable.

! Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower
! case characters. Using cipher1.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target
! As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that
! the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and
! find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.


! SOLUTION
! --------

! Assume that the space character will be the most common, so XOR the input
! text with a space character then group the text into three "columns" since
! that's how long our key is.  Then do frequency analysis on each column to
! find out what the most likely candidate is for the key.

! NOTE: This technique would probably not work well in all cases, but luckily
! it did for this particular problem.
