"A " { $emphasis "presentation" } " is a graphical view of an object which is directly linked to the object in some way. The help article links you see in the documentation browser are presentations; and if you " { $link see } " a word in the UI listener, all words in the definition will themselves be presentations."
$nl
"When you move the mouse over a presentation, it is highlighted with a rectangular border and a short summary of the object being presented is shown in the status bar (the summary is produced using the " { $link summary } " word)."
$nl
"Clicking a presentation with the left mouse button invokes a default operation, which usually views the object in some way. For example, clicking a presentation of a word jumps to the word definition in the " { $link "ui-browser" } "."
$nl
"Clicking and holding the right mouse button on a presentation displays a popup menu listing available operations."

"Presentation gadgets can be constructed directly using the " { $link <presentation> } " word, and they can also be written to " { $link pane } " gadgets using the " { $link write-object } " word." ;

ARTICLE: "ui-inspector" "UI inspector"
"The graphical inspector builds on the terminal inspector (see " { $link "inspector" } ") and provides in-place editing of slot values."

"To display an object in the UI inspector, use the " { $link inspect } " word from the UI listener, or right-click a presentation and choose " { $strong "Inspect" } " from the menu that appears."
$nl
"When the UI inspector is running, all of the terminal inspector words are available, such as " { $link &at } " and " { $link &put } ". Changing slot values using terminal inspector words automatically updates the UI inspector display."
$nl
"Slots can also be edited graphically. Clicking the ellipsis to the left of the slot's textual representation displays a slot editor gadget. A text representation of the object can be edited in the slot editor. The parser is used to turn the text representation back into an object. Keep in mind that some structure is lost in the conversion; see " { $link "prettyprint-limitations" } "."

ARTICLE: "ui-cocoa" "Functionality specific to Mac OS X"
"On Mac OS X, the Factor UI offers additional features which integrate with this operating system."
$nl
"First, a standard Mac-style menu bar is provided, which offers the bare minimum of what you would expect from a Mac OS X application."
$nl
"Dropping a source file onto the Factor icon in the dock runs the source file in the listener."
$nl
"If you install " { $strong "Factor.app" } " in your " { $strong "Applications" } " folder, then other applications will be able to call Factor via the System Services feature. For example, you can select some text in " { $strong "TextEdit.app" } ", then invoke the " { $strong "TextEdit->Services->Factor->Evaluate Selection" } " menu item, which will replace the selected text with the result of evaluating it in Factor."
