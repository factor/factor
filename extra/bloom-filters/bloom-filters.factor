TODO:

- The false positive rate is 10x what it should be, based on informal testing.
  Better object hashes or a better method of generating extra hash codes would
  help.  Another way is to increase the number of bits used.

  - Try something smarter than the bitwise complement for a second hash code.

  - http://spyced.blogspot.com/2009/01/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about.html
    makes a case for http://murmurhash.googlepages.com/ instead of enhanced
    double-hashing.

  - Be sure to adjust the test that asserts the number of false positives isn't
    unreasonable.

- Could round bits up to next power of two and use wrap instead of mod.  This
  would cost a lot of bits on 32-bit platforms, though, and limit the bit-array
  to 8MB.

- Should allow user to specify the hash codes, either as inputs to enhanced
  double hashing or for direct use.

- Support for serialization.

- Wrappers for combining filters.

- Should we signal an error when inserting past the number of objects the filter
  is sized for?  The filter will continue to work, just not very well.
