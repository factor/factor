TODO:

- The false positive rate is 10x what it should be, based on
  informal testing.  Better object hashes or a better method of
  generating extra hash codes would help.  Another way is to
  increase the number of bits used.

  - Try something smarter than the bitwise complement for a
    second hash code.

  - http://spyced.blogspot.com/2009/01/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about.html
    makes a case for http://murmurhash.googlepages.com/ instead
    of enhanced double-hashing.

  - Be sure to adjust the test that asserts the number of false
    positives isn't unreasonable.

- Could round bits up to next power of two and use wrap instead
  of mod.  This would cost a lot of bits on 32-bit platforms,
  though, and limit the bit-array to 8MB.

- Should allow user to specify the hash codes, either as inputs
  to enhanced double hashing or for direct use.

- Support for serialization.

- Wrappers for combining filters.

- Should we signal an error when inserting past the number of
  objects the filter is sized for?  The filter will continue to
  work, just not very well.
