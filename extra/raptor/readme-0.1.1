Raptor Linux

*** Introduction ***

Raptor Linux is a mod of Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake)

This is unlikely to work on another version of Ubuntu, much less
another Linux distribution.

*** Install ***

  ( scratchpad ) USE: raptor
  ( scratchpad ) save

  # mv -v /sbin/{init,init.orig}

  # cp -v /scratch/factor/factor /sbin/init

  # cp -v /scratch/factor/factor.image /sbin/init.image

  # mkdir -v /etc/raptor

  # cp -v /scratch/factor/extra/raptor/config.factor /etc/raptor/config.factor

*** Static IP networking ***

If you use a static IP in your network then Factor can take care of
networking.

  # emacs /etc/raptor/config.factor

  (change the settings accordingly)

The udev system has a hook to bring up ethernet interfaces when they
are detected. Let's remove this hook since we'll be bringing up the
interface. Actually, we'll move it, not delete it.

  # mv -v /etc/udev/rules.d/85-ifupdown.rules /root

*** DHCP networking ***

If you're using dhcp then we'll fall back on what Ubuntu offers. In
your config.factor change the line :

     start-networking

to

	"loopback"   start-service
	"networking" start-service

Add these to your reboot-hook and shutdown-hook :

	"loopback"   stop-service
	"networking" stop-service

*** Editing the hooks ***

The items in boot-hook correspond to the things in '/etc/rcS.d' and
'/etc/rc2.d'. Feel free to add and remove items from that hook. For
example, I removed the printer services. I also removed other things
that I didn't feel were necessary on my system.

*** Grub ***

Edit your '/boot/grub/menu.lst'. Basically, copy and paste your
current good entry. My default entry is this:

title           Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-28-686
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-28-686 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash
initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-28-686
savedefault
boot

I pasted a copy above it and edited it to look like this:

title           Raptor, kernel 2.6.15-28-686
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-28-686 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet -run=ubuntu.dapper.boot
initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-28-686
savedefault
boot

* Note that I removed the 'splash' kernel option

* Note the '-run=ubuntu.dapper.boot' option. Unfortunately, this isn't
  working yet...

*** Boot ***

Reboot or turn on your computer. Eventually, hopefully, you'll be at a
Factor prompt. Boot your system:

  ( scratchpad ) boot

You'll probably be prompted to select a vocab. Select 'raptor'.

*** Now what ***

The virtual consoles are allocated like so:

  1 - Main listener console
  2 - listener
  3 - listener
  4 - listener
  5 - getty
  6 - getty

So you're next step might be to alt-f5, login, and run startx.

*** Join the fun ***

Take a loot at what happens during run levels S and 2. Implement a
Factor version of something. Let me know about it.
