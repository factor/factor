    <h1>Parsers</h1>
<p class="note">The parser combinator library described here is based
  on a library written for the Clean pure functional programming language and
  described in chapter 5 of the 'Clean Book' (<a
  href="ftp://ftp.cs.kun.nl/pub/Clean/papers/cleanbook/II.05.ParserCombinators.pdf">PDF
  available here</a>). Based on the description
  in that chapter I developed a version for Factor, a concatenative
  language.</p>  
<p>A parser is a word or quotation that, when called, processes
   an input string on the stack, performs some parsing operation on
   it, and returns a result indicating the success of the parsing
   operation.</p> 
<p>The result returned by a parser is known as a 'list of
successes'. It is a lazy list of standard Factor cons cells. Each cons
cell is a result of a parse. The car of the cell is the remaining
input left to be parsed and the cdr of the cell is the result of the
parsing operation.</p>
<p>A lazy list is used for the result as a parse operation can potentially
return many successful results. For example, a parser that parses one
or more digits will return more than one result for the input "123". A
successful parse could be "1", "12" or "123".</p>
<p>The list is lazy so if only one parse result is required the
remaining results won't actually be processed if they are not
requested. This improves efficiency.</p>
<p>The cdr of the result pair can be any value that the parser wishes
to return. It could be the successful portion of the input string
parsed, an abstract syntax tree representing the parsed input, or even
a quotation that should get called for later processing.</p>
<p>A Parser Combinator is a word that takes one or more parsers and
returns a parser that when called uses the original parsers in some
manner.</p>
<h1>Example Parsers</h1>
<p>The following are some very simple parsers that demonstrate how
general parsers work and the 'list of sucesses' that are returned as a
result.</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) : char-a ( inp -- result )
        0 over string-nth CHAR: a = [
          1 swap string-tail CHAR: a cons unit delay lunit
        ] [
          drop lnil
        ] ifte ;
  (2) "atest" char-a [ [ . ] leach ] when*
      =&gt; [[ "test" 97 ]]
  (3) "test"  char-a [ [ . ] leach ] when*
      =&gt;
</pre>
<p>'char-a' is a parser that only accepts the character 'a' in the
input string. When passed an input string with a string with a leading
'a' then the 'list of successes' has 1 result value. The cdr of that
result value is the character 'a' successfully parsed, and the car is
the remaining input string. On failure of the parse an empty list is
returned.</p> 
<p>The parser combinator library provides a combinator, &lt;&amp;&gt;, that takes
two parsers off the stack and returns a parser that calls the original
two in sequence. An example of use would be calling 'char-a' twice,
which would then result in an input string expected with two 'a'
characters leading:</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) "aatest" [ char-a ] [ char-a ] &lt;&amp;&gt; call
      =&gt; < list of successes >
  (2) [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [[ "test" [[ 97 97 ]] ]]
</pre>
<h2>Tokens</h2>
<p>Creating parsers for specfic characters and tokens can be a chore
so there is a word that, given a string token on the stack, returns
a parser that parses that particular token:</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) "begin" token 
      =&gt; < a parser that parses the token "begin" >
  (2) dup "this should fail" swap call lnil? .
      =&gt; t
  (3) "begin a successfull parse" swap call 
      =&gt; < lazy list >
  (4) [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [[ " a successfull parse" "begin" ]]
</pre>
<h2>Predicate matching</h2>
<p>The word 'satisfy' takes a quotation from the top of the stack and
returns a parser than when called will call the quotation with the
first item in the input string on the stack. If the quotation returns
true then the parse is successful, otherwise it fails:</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) : digit-parser ( -- parser )
        [ digit? ] satisfy ;
  (2) "5" digit-parser call [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [[ "" 53 ]]
  (3) "a" digit-parser call lnil? .
      =&gt; t
</pre>
<p>Note that 'digit-parser' returns a parser, it is not the parser
itself. It is really a parser generating word like 'token'. Whereas
our 'char-a' word defined originally was a parser itself.</p>
<h2>Zero or more matches</h2>
<p>Now that we can parse single digits it would be nice to easily
parse a string of them. The '<*>' parser combinator word will do
this. It accepts a parser on the top of the stack and produces a
parser that parses zero or more of the constructs that the original
parser parsed. The result of the '<*>' generated parser will be a list
of the successful results returned by the original parser.</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) digit-parser <*>
      =&gt; < parser >
  (2) "123" swap call
      =&gt; < lazy list >
  (3) [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [ "" [ 49 50 51 ] ]
           [ "3" [ 49 50 ] ]
           [ "23" [ 49 ] ]
           [ "123" ]
</pre>
<p>In this case there are multiple successful parses. This is because
the occurrence of zero or more digits happens more than once. There is
also the 'f' case where zero digits is parsed. If only the 'longest
match' is required then the lcar of the lazy list can be used and the
remaining parse results are never produced.</p>
<h2>Manipulating parse trees</h2>
<p>The result of the previous parse was the list of characters
parsed. Sometimes you want this to be something else, like an abstract
syntax tree, or some calculation. For the digit case we may want the
actual integer number.</p>
<p>For this we can use the '&lt;@' parser
combinator. This combinator takes a parser and a quotation on the
stack and returns a new parser. When the new parser is called it will
call the original parser to produce the results, then it will call the
quotation on each successfull result, and the result of that quotation
will be the result of the parse:</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) : digit-parser2 ( -- parser )
        [ digit? ] satisfy [ digit> ] &lt;@ ;
  (2) "5" digit-parser2 call [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [[ "" 5 ]]
</pre>
<p>Notice that now the result is the actual integer '5' rather than
character code '53'.</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) : digit-list>number ( list -- number )
         #! Converts a list of digits to a number
         [ >digit ] map >string dup empty? [ 
           drop 0 
         ] [
	   str>number 
         ]  ifte ;
  (2) : natural-parser ( -- parser )
        digit-parser2 <*> [ car digit-list>number unit  ] &lt;@  ;
  (3) "123" natural-parser call
      =&gt; < lazy list >
  (4) [ . ] leach
      =&gt; [ "" 123 ]
           [ "3" 12 ]
           [ "23" 1 ]
           [ "123" 0 ]
           [ [ 123 ] | "" ]
</pre>
<p>The number parsed is the actual integer number due to the operation
of the '&lt;@' word. This allows parsers to not only parse the input
string but perform operations and transformations on the syntax tree
returned.</p>
<p>A useful debugging method to work out what to use in the quotation
passed to &lt;@ is to write an initial version of the parser that just
displays the topmost item on the stack:</p>
<pre class="code">
  (1) : natural-parser-debug ( -- parser )
        digit-parser2 <*> [ "debug: " write dup . ] &lt;@  ;
  (3) "123" natural-parser-debug call lcar .
      =&gt; debug: [ [ 1 2 3 ] ]
           [ "" [ 1 2 3 ] ]
</pre>
<p>From the debug output we can see how to manipulate the result to
get what we want. In this case it's the quotation in the previous example.</p>
 
<h2>Sequential combinator</h2>
<p>To create a full grammar we need a parser combinator that does
sequential compositions. That is, given two parsers, the sequential
combinator will first run the first parser, and then run the second on
the remaining text to be parsed. As the first parser returns a lazy
list, the second parser will be run on each item of the lazy list. Of
course this is done lazily so it only ends up being done when those
list items are requested. The sequential combinator word is &lt;&amp;&gt;.</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) "number:" token 
       =&gt; < parser that parses the text 'number:' >
  ( 2 ) natural-parser
       =&gt; < parser that parses natural numbers >
  ( 3 ) &lt;&amp;&gt;
       =&gt; < parser that parses 'number:' followed by a natural >
  ( 4 ) "number:100" swap call
       =&gt; < list of successes >
  ( 5 ) [ . ] leach
       =&gt; [ "" "number:" 100 ]
            [ "0" "number:" 10 ]
            [ "00" "number:" 1 ]
            [ "100" "number:" 0 ]
</pre>
<p>In this  example we might prefer not to have the parse result
contain the token, we want just the number. Two alternatives to &lt;&amp;&gt;
provide the ability to select which result to use from the two
parsers. These operators are &lt;&amp; and &amp;&gt;. The &lt; or &gt; points 
in the direction of which parser to retain the results from. So our
example above could be:</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) "number:" token 
       =&gt; < parser that parses the text 'number:' >
  ( 2 ) natural-parser
       =&gt; < parser that parses natural numbers >
  ( 3 ) &amp;&gt;
       =&gt; < parser that parses 'number:' followed by a natural >
  ( 4 ) "number:100" swap call
       =&gt; < list of successes >
  ( 5 ) [ . ] leach
       =&gt; [ "" 100 ]
            [ "0" 10 ]
            [ "00" 1 ]
            [ "100" 0 ]
</pre>
<p>Notice how the parse result only contains the number due to &&gt;
being used to retain the result of the second parser.</p>

<h2>Choice combinator</h2>
<p>As well as a sequential combinator we need an alternative
combinator. The word for this is &lt;|&gt;. It takes two parsers from the
stack and returns a parser that will first try the first parser. If it
succeeds then the result for that is returned. If it fails then the
second parser is tried and its result returned.</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) "one" token
        =&gt; < parser that parses the text 'one' >
  ( 2 ) "two" token 
        =&gt; < parser that parses the text 'two' >
  ( 3 ) &lt;|&gt;
        =&gt; < parser that parses 'one' or 'two' >
  ( 4 ) "one" over call [ . ] leach
        =&gt; [[ "" "one" ]]
  ( 5 ) "two" swap call [ . ] leach
        =&gt; [[ "" "two" ]]
</pre>

<h2>Option combinator</h2>
<p>The option combinator, &lt;?&gt; allows adding optional elements to
a parser. It takes one parser off the stack and if the parse succeeds
add it to the result tree, otherwise it will ignore it and
continue. The example below extends our natural-parser to parse
integers with an optional leading minus sign.</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) : integer-parser
          "-" token &lt;?&gt; natural-parser &lt;&amp;&gt; ;
  ( 2 ) "200" integer-parser call [ . ] leach 
       =&gt; [ "" [ ] 200 ]
            [ "0" [ ] 20 ]
            [ "00" [ ] 2 ]
            [ "200" [ ] 0 ]
  ( 3 ) "-200" integer-parser call [ . ] leach
       =&gt; [ "" [ "-" ] 200 ]
            [ "0" [ "-" ] 20 ]
            [ "00" [ "-" ] 2 ]
            [ "200" [ "-" ] 0 ]
            [ "-200" [ ] 0 ]
  ( 4 ) : integer-parser2
          integer-parser [ uncons swap [ car -1 * ] when ] &lt;@ ;
  ( 5 ) "200" integer-parser2 call [ . ] leach 
       =&gt; [ "" 200 ]
            [ "0" 20 ]
            [ "00" 2 ]
            [ "200" 0 ]
  ( 6 ) "-200" integer-parser2 call [ . ] leach
       =&gt; [ "" -200 ]
            [ "0" -20 ]
            [ "00" -2 ]
            [ "200" 0 ]
            [ "-200" 0 ]

</pre>

<h2>Skipping Whitespace</h2>
<p>A parser transformer exists, the word 'sp', that takes an existing
parser and returns a new one that will first skip any whitespace
before calling the original parser. This makes it easy to write
grammers that avoid whitespace without having to explicitly code it
into the grammar.</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) "  123" natural-parser call [ . ] leach
        =&gt; [ "  123" 0 ]
  ( 2 ) "  123" natural-parser sp call [ . ] leach
        =&gt; [ "" 123 ]
             [ "3" 12 ]
             [ "23" 1 ]
             [ "123" 0 ]
</pre>
<h2>Eval grammar example</h2>
<p>This example presents a simple grammar that will parse a number
followed by an operator and another number. A factor expression that
computes the entered value will be executed.</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) natural-parser
        =&gt; < a parser for natural numbers >
  ( 2 ) "/" token "*" token "+" token "-" token &lt;|&gt; &lt;|&gt; &lt;|&gt;
        =&gt; < a parser for the operator >
  ( 3 ) sp [ "\\ " swap cat2 eval unit ] &lt;@
        =&gt; < operator parser that skips whitespace and converts to a 
             factor expression >
  ( 4 ) natural-parser sp
        =&gt; < a whitespace skipping natural parser >
  ( 5 ) &lt;&amp;&gt; &lt;&amp;&gt; [ uncons uncons swap append append call ] &lt;@
        =&gt; < a parser that parsers the expression, converts it to
             factor, calls it and puts the result in the parse tree >
  ( 6 ) "123 + 456" over call lcar .
        =&gt; [[ "" 579 ]]
  ( 7 ) "300-100" over call lcar .
        =&gt; [[ "" 200 ]]
  ( 8 ) "200/2" over call lcar .
        =&gt; [[ "" 100 ]]
</pre>
<p>It looks complicated when expanded as above but the entire parser,
factored a little, looks quite readable:</p>
<pre class="code">
  ( 1 ) : operator ( -- parser )
          "/" token 
          "*" token &lt;|&gt;
          "+" token &lt;|&gt;
          "-" token &lt;|&gt;
          [ "\\ " swap cat2 eval unit ] &lt;@ ;
  ( 2 ) : expression ( -- parser )
          natural-parser 
          operator sp &lt;&amp;&gt;  
          natural-parser sp &lt;&amp;&gt; 
          [ uncons swap uncons -rot append append reverse call ] &lt;@ ;
  ( 3 ) "40+2" expression call lcar .
        =&gt; [[ "" 42 ]]
