ARTICLE: "boyer-moore" "The Boyer-Moore algorithm"
{ $heading "Summary" }
"The " { $vocab-link "boyer-moore" } " vocabulary "
"implements a Boyer-Moore string search algorithm with the "
"so-called 'strong good suffix shift rule'. Since the algorithm is "
"alphabet-independent, it is applicable to searching in any "
"collection that implements the " { $links "sequence-protocol" } "."

{ $heading "Complexity" }
"Let " { $snippet "n" } " and " { $snippet "m" } " be the lengths "
"of the sequences being searched " { $emphasis "in" } " and "
{ $emphasis "for" } " respectively. Then searching runs in "
{ $snippet "O(n)" } " time worst-case, using additional "
{ $snippet "O(m)" } " space. The preprocessing phase runs in "
{ $snippet "O(m)" } " time."
