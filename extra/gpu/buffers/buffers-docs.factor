HELP: buffer
{ $class-description "Objects of this class represent GPU-accessible memory buffers. Buffer objects can be used to store vertex data and to update or read pixel data from textures and framebuffers without CPU involvement. The data inside buffer objects may be resident in main memory or different parts of GPU memory; the graphics driver will choose a location for a buffer based on usage hints specified when the buffer object is constructed with " { $link <buffer> } " or " { $link byte-array>buffer } ":"

"These settings are only performance hints and do not restrict the usage of the buffer in any way. For example, a buffer constructed as a " { $link vertex-buffer } " with " { $link static-upload } " can still receive pixel data as though it were a " { $link pixel-pack-buffer } ", and can still be updated with " { $link copy-buffer } " or " { $link update-buffer } ".
