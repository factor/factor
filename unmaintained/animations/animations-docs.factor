ARTICLE: "animations" "Animations"
"Provides a lightweight framework for properly simulating continuous"
" functions of real time. This framework helps one create animations "
"that use rates which do not change across platforms. The speed of the "
"computer should correlate with the smoothness of the animation, not "
"the speed of the animation!"

! A little talk about when to use progress and when to use animate
    { $link progress } " specifically provides the length of time since "
    { $link reset-progress } " was called, and also calls "
    { $link reset-progress } " as its last action. This can be directly "
    "used when one's quote runs for a specific number of iterations, instead "
    "of a length of time. If the animation is like most, and is expected to "
    "run for a specific length of time, " { $link animate } " should be used." ;
