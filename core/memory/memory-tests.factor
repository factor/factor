! Bug: allocation of large objects directly into tenured space
! can proceed past the high water mark.
!
! Suppose the nursery and aging spaces are mostly comprised of
! reachable objects. When doing a full GC, objects from young
! generations ere promoted *before* unreachable objects in
! tenured space are freed by the sweep phase. So if large object
! allocation filled up the heap past the high water mark, this
! promotion might trigger heap growth, even if most of those
! large objects are unreachable.
