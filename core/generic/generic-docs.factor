"It is possible that two classes have a non-empty intersection and neither is a subclass of the other. This means there is no canonical linear ordering of classes."

"Consider the following set of definitions:"
{ $code
    "GENERIC: explain"
    "M: general-t explain drop \"a true value\" print ;"

"Neither " { $link general-t } " nor " { $link sequence } " are subclasses of each other, yet their intersection is non-empty. So the generic word system will place " { $link object } " first in the method order, however either " { $link general-t } " or " { $link sequence } " may come next, and it is pretty much a random choice that depends on hashing:"

"The combination quotation passed to " { $link define-generic } " has stack effect " { $snippet "( word -- quot )" } ".
