"These words assume the sequence index given is within bounds; if it is not, memory corruption can occur. Great care must be exercised when using these words. First, make sure the code in question is actually a bottleneck; next, try improving the algorithm first. If all else fails, then the unsafe sequence words can be used."
$nl
"There is a very important invariant these word must preserve: if at some point in time, the length of a sequence was " { $snippet "n" } ", then any future lookups of elements with indices below " { $snippet "n" } " must not crash the VM, even if the sequence length is now less than " { $snippet "n" } ". For example, vectors preserve this invariant by never shrinking the underlying storage, only growing it as necessary."
$nl
"The justification for this is that the VM should not crash if a resizable sequence is resized during the execution of an iteration combinator."
$nl
"Indeed, iteration combinators are the primary use-case for these words; if the iteration index is already guarded by a loop test which ensures it is within bounds, then additional bounds checks are redundant. For example, see the implementation of " { $link each } "." ;

ARTICLE: "sequences-slices" "Subsequences and slices"
"There are two ways to extract a subrange of elements from a sequence. The first approach creates a new sequence of the same type as the input, which does not share storage with the underlying sequence. This takes time proportional to the number of elements being extracted. The second approach creates a " { $emphasis "slice" } ", which is a virtual sequence (see " { $link "virtual-sequences" } ") sharing storage with the original sequence. Slices are constructed in constant time."
$nl
"Some general guidelines for choosing between the two approaches:"
{ $list
  "If you are using mutable state, the choice has to be made one way or another because of semantics; mutating a slice will change the underlying sequence."
  { "Using a slice can improve algorithmic complexity. For example, if each iteration of a loop decomposes a sequence using " { $link first } " and " { $link rest } ", then the loop will run in quadratic time, relative to the length of the sequence. Using " { $link rest-slice } " changes the loop to run in linear time, since " { $link rest-slice } " does not copy any elements. Taking a slice of a slice will “collapse” the slice so to avoid the double indirection, so it is safe to use slices in recursive code." }
  "Accessing elements from a concrete sequence (such as a string or an array) is often faster than accessing elements from a slice, because slice access entails additional indirection. However, in some cases, if the slice is immediately consumed by an iteration combinator, the compiler can eliminate the slice allocation and indirect altogether."
  "If the slice outlives the original sequence, the original sequence will still remain in memory, since the slice will reference it. This can increase memory consumption unnecessarily."

"Constructive (non-destructive) operations should be preferred where possible because code without side-effects is usually more re-usable and easier to reason about. There are two main reasons to use destructive operations:"
{ $list
    "For the side-effect. Some code is simpler to express with destructive operations; constructive operations return new objects, and sometimes ``threading'' the objects through the program manually complicates stack shuffling."
    { "As an optimization. Some code can be written to use constructive operations, however would suffer from worse performance. An example is a loop which adds an element to a sequence on each iteration; one could use either " { $link suffix } " or " { $link push } ", however the former copies the entire sequence first, which would cause the loop to run in quadratic time." }
}
"The second reason is much weaker than the first one.
