"The " { $link nth-unsafe } " and " { $link set-nth-unsafe } " sequence protocol bypasses bounds checks for increased performance."
$nl
"These words assume the sequence index given is within bounds; if it is not, memory corruption can occur. Great care must be exercised when using these words. First, make sure the code in question is actually a bottleneck; next, try improving the algorithm first. If all else fails, then the unsafe sequence words can be used."
$nl
"There is a very important invariant these word must preserve: if at some point in time, the length of a sequence was " { $snippet "n" } ", then any future lookups of elements with indices below " { $snippet "n" } " must not crash the VM, even if the sequence length is now less than " { $snippet "n" } ". For example, vectors preserve this invariant by never shrinking the underlying storage, only growing it as necessary."
$nl
"The justification for this is that the VM should not crash if a resizable sequence is resized during the execution of an iteration combinator."
$nl
"Indeed, iteration combinators are the primary use-case for these words; if the iteration index is already guarded by a loop test which ensures it is within bounds, then additional bounds checks are redundant. For example, see the implementation of " { $link each } "." ;
