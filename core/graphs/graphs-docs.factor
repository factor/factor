"Words for treating associative mappings as directed graphs can be found in the " { $vocab-link "graphs" } " vocabulary. A directed graph is represented as an assoc mapping each vertex to a " { $link hash-set } " of edges entering that vertex."

"To create a new graph, just create an assoc, for example by calling " { $link <hashtable> } ". To add vertices and edges to a graph:"

"To remove vertices from the graph:"
{ $subsections remove-vertex }
"Since graphs are represented as assocs, they can be cleared out by calling " { $link clear-assoc } "."

"You can perform queries on a graph:"
