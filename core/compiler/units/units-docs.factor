"When a source file is being parsed, all definitions are part of a single compilation unit, unless the " { $link POSTPONE: << } " parsing word is used to create nested compilation units."
$nl
"Words defined in a compilation unit may not be called until the compilation unit is finished. The parser detects this case for parsing words and throws a " { $link staging-violation } ". Similarly, an attempt to use a macro from a word defined in the same compilation unit will throw a " { $link transform-expansion-error } ". Calling any other word from within its own compilation unit throws an " { $link undefined } " error."

"This means that parsing words and macros generally cannot be used in the same source file as they are defined. There are two means of getting around this:"
