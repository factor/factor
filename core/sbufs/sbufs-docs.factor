"String buffers implement the " { $link "sequence-protocol" } " and thus all " { $link "sequences" } " can be used with them. String buffers can be used to construct new strings by accumilating substrings and characters, however usually they are only used indirectly, since the sequence construction words are more convenient to use in most cases (see " { $link "namespaces-make" } ")."
