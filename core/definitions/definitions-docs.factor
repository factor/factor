ARTICLE: "definition-checking" "Definition sanity checking"
"When a source file is reloaded, the parser compares the previous list of definitions with the current list; any definitions which are no longer present in the file are removed by a call to " { $link forget } ". A warning message is printed if any other definitions still depend on the removed definitions."
$nl
"The parser also catches forward references when reloading source files. This is best illustrated with an example. Suppose we load a source file " { $snippet "a.factor" } ":"
{ $code
    "USING: io sequences ;"
    "IN: a"
    ": hello \"Hello\" ;"
    ": world \"world\" ;"
    ": hello-world hello " " world 3append print ;"
}
"The definitions for " { $snippet "hello" } ", " { $snippet "world" } ", and " { $snippet "hello-world" } " are in the dictionary."
$nl
"Now, after some heavily editing and refactoring, the file looks like this:"
{ $code
    "USING: namespaces ;"
    "IN: a"
    ": hello \"Hello\" % ;"
    ": hello-world [ hello " " % world ] \"\" make ;"
    ": world \"world\" % ;"
}
"Note that the developer has made a mistake, placing the definition of " { $snippet "world" } " " { $emphasis "after" } " its usage in " { $snippet "hello-world" } "."
$nl
"If the parser did not have special checks for this case, then the modified source file would still load, because when the definition of " { $snippet "hello-world" } " on line 4 is being parsed, the " { $snippet "world" } " word is already present in the dictionary from an earlier run. The developer would then not discover this mistake until attempting to load the source file into a fresh image."
$nl
"Since this is undesirable, the parser explicitly raises a " { $link no-word } " error if a source file refers to a word which is in the dictionary, but defined after it is used."
$nl
"The parser also catches duplicate definitions. If an artifact is defined twice in the same source file, the earlier definition will never be accessible, and this is almost always a mistake, perhaps due to a bad choice of word names, or a copy and paste error. The parser raises an error in this case."
