"The parser also catches forward references when reloading source files. This is best illustrated with an example. Suppose we load a source file " { $snippet "a.factor" } ":"
{ $code
    "USING: io sequences ;"
    "IN: a"
    ": hello \"Hello\" ;"

$nl
"If the parser did not have special checks for this case, then the modified source file would still load, because when the definition of " { $snippet "hello-world" } " on line 4 is being parsed, the " { $snippet "world" } " word is already present in the dictionary from an earlier run. The developer would then not discover this mistake until attempting to load the source file into a fresh image."
$nl
"Since this is undesirable, the parser explicitly raises a " { $link no-word } " error if a source file refers to a word which is in the dictionary, but defined after it is used."
$nl
"The parser also catches duplicate definitions. If an artifact is defined twice in the same source file, the earlier definition will never be accessible, and this is almost always a mistake, perhaps due to a bad choice of word names, or a copy and paste error.
