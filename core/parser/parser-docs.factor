ARTICLE: "parsing-word-nest" "Nested structure"
"Recall that the parser loop calls parsing words with an accumulator vector on the stack. The parser loop can be invoked recursively with a new, empty accumulator; the result can then be added to the original accumulator. This is how parsing words for object literals are implemented; object literals can nest arbitrarily deep."
$nl
"A simple example is the parsing word that reads a quotation:"
{ $see POSTPONE: [ }
"This word uses a utility word which recursively invokes the parser, reading objects into a new accumulator until an occurrence of " { $link POSTPONE: ] } ":"
{ $subsections parse-literal }
"There is another, lower-level word for reading nested structure, which is also useful when called directly:"

{ $see POSTPONE: SYMBOL: }
"The key factor in the definition of " { $link POSTPONE: SYMBOL: } " is " { $link scan-new } ", which reads a token from the input and creates a word with that name. This word is then passed to " { $link define-symbol } "."

"Colon definitions are defined in a more elaborate way:"

ARTICLE: "parsing-tokens" "Parsing raw tokens"
"So far we have seen how to read individual tokens, or read a sequence of parsed objects until a delimiter. It is also possible to read raw tokens from the input and perform custom processing."
$nl
"One example is the " { $link POSTPONE: USING: } " parsing word."
{ $see POSTPONE: USING: }
"It reads a list of vocabularies terminated by " { $link POSTPONE: ; } ". However, the vocabulary names do not name words, except by coincidence; so " { $link parse-until } " cannot be used here. Instead, a set of lower-level combinators can be used:"

ARTICLE: "parsing-words" "Parsing words"
"The Factor parser follows a simple recursive-descent design. The parser reads successive tokens from the input; if the token identifies a number or an ordinary word, it is added to an accumulator vector. Otherwise if the token identifies a parsing word, the parsing word is executed immediately."
$nl
"Parsing words are defined using the defining word:"
{ $subsections POSTPONE: SYNTAX: }
"Parsing words have uppercase names by convention. Here is the simplest possible parsing word; it prints a greeting at parse time:"
{ $code "SYNTAX: HELLO \"Hello world\" print ;" }
"Parsing words must not pop or push items from the stack; however, they are permitted to access the accumulator vector supplied by the parser at the top of the stack. That is, parsing words must have stack effect " { $snippet "( accum -- accum )" } ", where " { $snippet "accum" } " is the accumulator vector supplied by the parser."
$nl
"Parsing words can read input, add word definitions to the dictionary, and do anything an ordinary word can."
$nl
"Because of the stack restriction, parsing words cannot pass data to other words by leaving values on the stack; instead, use " { $link suffix! } " to add the data to the parse tree so that it can be evaluated later."
$nl
"Parsing words cannot be called from the same source file where they are defined, because new definitions are only compiled at the end of the source file. An attempt to use a parsing word in its own source file raises an error:"

"Any code outside of a definition is known as a " { $emphasis "top-level form" } "; top-level forms are run after the entire source file has been parsed, regardless of their position in the file."
$nl
"Top-level forms cannot access the parse-time manifest (" { $link "word-search-parsing" } "), nor do they run inside " { $link with-compilation-unit } "; as a result, meta-programming might require extra work in a top-level form compared with a parsing word."
$nl
"Also, top-level forms run in a new dynamic scope, so using " { $link set } " to store values is almost always wrong, since the values will be lost after the top-level form completes. To save values computed by a top-level form, either use " { $link set-global } " or define a new word with the value." ;

ARTICLE: "parser" "The parser"
"The Factor parser reads textual representations of objects and definitions, with all syntax determined by " { $link "parsing-words" } ". The parser is implemented in the " { $vocab-link "parser" } " vocabulary, with standard syntax in the " { $vocab-link "syntax" } " vocabulary. See " { $link "syntax" } " for a description of standard syntax."
