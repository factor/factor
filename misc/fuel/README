FUEL, Factor's Ultimate Emacs Library
-------------------------------------

FUEL provides a complete environment for your Factor coding pleasure
inside Emacs, including source code edition and interaction with a
Factor listener instance running within Emacs.

FUEL was started by Jose A Ortega as an extension to Eduardo Cavazos'
original factor.el code. Eduardo is also responsible of naming the
beast.

* Installation

  FUEL comes bundled with Factor's distribution. The folder misc/fuel
  contains Elisp code, and there's a fuel vocabulary in extras/fuel.

  To install FUEL, either add this line to your Emacs initialisation:

  (load-file "<path/to/factor/installation>/misc/fuel/fu.el")

  If all you want is a major mode for editing Factor code with pretty
  font colors and indentation, without running the factor listener
  inside Emacs, you can use instead:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "<path/to/factor/installation>/fuel")
  (setq factor-mode-use-fuel nil)
  (require 'factor-mode)

* Basic usage
*** Running the listener

    If you're using the default factor binary and images locations inside
    the Factor's source tree, that should be enough to start using FUEL.
    Editing any file with the extension .factor will put you in
    factor-mode; try C-hm for a summary of available commands.

    To start the listener, try M-x run-factor.

    By default, FUEL will try to use the binary and image files in the
    factor installation directory. You can customize them with:

    (setq fuel-listener-factor-binary <full path to factor>)
    (setq fuel-listener-factor-image <full path to factor image>)

    Many aspects of the environment can be customized:
    M-x customize-group fuel will show you how many.

*** Faster listener startup

    On startup, run-factor loads the fuel vocabulary, which can take a
    while. If you want to speedup the load process, type 'save' in the
    listener prompt just after invoking run-factor. This will save a
    factor image (overwriting the current one) with all the needed
    vocabs.

    Alternatively, you can add the following line to your
    .factor-boot-rc file:

       "fuel" require

    This will ensure that the image generated while bootstrapping
    Factor contains fuel and the vocabularies it depends on.

*** Connecting to a running Factor

    'run-factor' starts a new factor listener process managed by Emacs.
    If you prefer to start Factor externally, you can also connect
    remotely from Emacs. Here's how to proceed:

    - In the factor listener, run FUEL: "fuel" run
      This will start a server listener in port 9000.
    - Switch to Emacs and issue the command 'M-x connect-to-factor'.

  That's it; you should be up and running. See the help for
  'connect-to-factor' for how to use a different port.

*** Vocabulary creation

    FUEL offers a basic interface to Factor's scaffolding utilities.
    To create a new vocabulary directory and associated files:

       M-x fuel-scaffold-vocab

    and when in a vocab file, to create a docs file with boilerplate
    for each word:

       M-x fuel-scaffold-help

* Quick key reference

  Triple chords ending in a single letter <x> accept also C-<x> (e.g.
  C-c C-e C-r is the same as C-c C-e r).

*** In factor source files:

    Commands in parenthesis can be invoked interactively with
    M-x <command>, not necessarily in a factor buffer.
