FUEL, Factor's Ultimate Emacs Library
-------------------------------------

FUEL provides a complete environment for your Factor coding pleasure
inside Emacs, including source code edition and interaction with a
Factor listener instance running within Emacs.

FUEL was started by Jose A Ortega as an extension to Ed Cavazos'
original factor.el code.

Installation
------------

FUEL comes bundled with Factor's distribution. The folder misc/fuel
contains Elisp code, and there's a fuel vocabulary in extras/fuel.

To install FUEL, either add this line to your Emacs initialisation:

  (load-file "<path/to/factor/installation>/misc/fuel/fu.el")

or

  (add-to-list load-path "<path/to/factor/installation>/fuel")
  (require 'fuel)

If all you want is a major mode for editing Factor code with pretty
font colors and indentation, without running the factor listener
inside Emacs, you can use instead:

  (add-to-list load-path "<path/to/factor/installation>/fuel")
  (setq factor-mode-use-fuel nil)
  (require 'factor-mode)

Basic usage
-----------

If you're using the default factor binary and images locations inside
the Factor's source tree, that should be enough to start using FUEL.
Editing any file with the extension .factor will put you in
factor-mode; try C-hm for a summary of available commands.

To start the listener, try M-x run-factor.

Many aspects of the environment can be customized:
M-x customize-group fuel will show you how many.

Quick key reference
-------------------

(Chords ending in a single letter <x> accept also C-<x> (e.g. C-cC-z is
the same as C-cz)).
