;;; Commentary:

;; FUEL provides a complete environment for your Factor coding pleasure
;; inside Emacs, including source code edition and interaction with a
;; Factor listener instance running within Emacs.

;; FUEL was started by Jose A Ortega as an extension to Eduardo Cavazos'
;; original factor.el code. Eduardo is also responsible of naming the
;; beast.

;;; Code:

(require 'fuel-mode)
(provide 'fuel)

;;; fuel.el ends here
