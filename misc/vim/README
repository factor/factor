Vim support for Factor
----------------------

This directory contains various support files that make editing Factor code
more pleasant in Vim. The file-layout exactly matches the Vim runtime
structure, so you can install them by copying the contents of this directory
into ~/.vim/ or the equivalent path on other platforms (Open Vim and type
":help 'runtimepath'" for details).

The current set of files is as follows:

    ftdetect/factor.vim
	Teach Vim when to load Factor support files.
    ftplugin/factor_settings.vim
	Teach Vim to follow the Factor Coding Style guidelines.
    syntax/factor.vim
        Syntax highlighting for Factor code.

Note: The syntax-highlighting file is automatically generated to include the
names of all the vocabularies Factor knows about. To regenerate it manually,
run the following code in the listener:

    USE: editors.vim.generate-syntax

    generate-vim-syntax

...or run it from the command-line:

    factor -run=editors.vim.generate-syntax
