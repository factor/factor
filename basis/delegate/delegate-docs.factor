ARTICLE: "delegate" "Delegation"
"The " { $vocab-link "delegate" } " vocabulary implements run-time consultation for method dispatch."
$nl
"A " { $emphasis "protocol" } " is a collection of related generic words. An object is said to " { $emphasis "consult" } " another object if it implements a protocol by forwarding all methods onto the other object."
$nl
"Using this vocabulary, protocols can be defined and consulation can be set up without any repetitive boilerplate."
$nl
"Unlike " { $link "tuple-subclassing" } ", which expresses " { $emphasis "is-a" } " relationships by statically including the methods and slots of the superclass in all subclasses, consultation forwards generic word calls to another distinct object."

"Every tuple class has an associated protocol consisting of all of its slot accessor methods.
