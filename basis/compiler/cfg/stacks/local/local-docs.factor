ARTICLE: "compiler.cfg.stacks.local" "Local stack analysis"
"For each " { $link basic-block } " in the " { $link cfg } ", local stack analysis is performed. The analysis is started right after the block is created with " { $link begin-local-analysis } " and finished with " { $link end-local-analysis } ", when the construction of the block is complete. During the analysis, three sets containing stack locations are built:"
{ $list
  { { $slot "peeks" } " all stack locations that the block reads before writing" }
  { { $slot "replaces" } " all stack locations that the block writes" }
  { { $slot "kills" } " all stack locations which become unavailable after the block ends because of the stack height being decremented. For example, if the block contains " { $link drop } ", then D: 0 will be contained in kills because that stack location will not be live anymore." }
}
"This is done while constructing the CFG. These sets are then used by the " { $link end-stack-analysis } " word to emit optimal sequences of " { $link ##peek } " and " { $link ##replace } " instructions to the cfg."

"For example, the code [ dup dup dup ] will only execute ##peek once, instead of three time which a 'non-lazy' method would."
