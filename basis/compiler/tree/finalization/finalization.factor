! This is a late-stage optimization.
! See the comment in compiler.tree.late-optimizations.

! This pass runs after propagation, so that it can expand
! type predicates; these cannot be expanded before
! propagation since we need to see 'fixnum?' instead of
! 'tag 0 eq?' and so on, for semantic reasoning.

! We also delete empty stack shuffles and copies to facilitate
! tail call optimization in the code generator.
