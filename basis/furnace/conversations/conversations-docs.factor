ARTICLE: "furnace.conversations" "Furnace conversation scope"
"The " { $vocab-link "furnace.conversations" } " vocabulary implements conversation scope, which allows data to be passed between requests on a finer level of granularity than session scope."
$nl
"Conversation scope is used by form validation to pass validation errors between requests."
$nl
"To use conversation scope, wrap your responder in an conversation responder:"
{ $subsections <conversations> }
"The conversations responder must be wrapped inside a session responder (" { $link <sessions> } "), which in turn must be wrapped inside a database persistence responder (" { $link <db-persistence> } "). The " { $vocab-link "furnace.alloy" } " vocabulary combines all of these responders into one."
$nl
"Managing conversation scopes:"
{ $subsections
    begin-conversation
    end-conversation
    <continue-conversation>
}
"Reading and writing conversation variables:"
{ $subsections
    cget
    cset
    cchange
}
"Note that conversation scope is serialized as part of the session, which means that only serializable objects can be stored there. See " { $link "furnace.sessions.serialize" } " for details." ;
