"The " { $link sessions } " tuple has two slots which contain configuration parameters:"
{ $table
    { { $slot "verify?" } { "If set to a true value, the client IP address and user agent of each session is tracked, and checked every time a client attempts to re-establish a session. While this does not offer any real security, it can thwart unskilled packet-sniffing attacks. On by default." } }

Note that for sessions to actually expire, you must start a thread to do so; see the " { $vocab-link "furnace.alloy" } " vocabulary for an easy way of doing this." } }

"This means that there are three restrictions on the values stored in the session:"
{ $list
    "Continuations cannot be stored at all."
    { "Object identity is not preserved between serialization and deserialization. That is, if an object is stored with " { $link sset } " and later retrieved with " { $link sget } ", the retrieved value will be " { $link = } " to the original, but not necessarily " { $link eq? } "." }
    { "All objects reachable from the value passed to " { $link sset } " are serialized, so large structures should not be stored in the session state, and neither should anything that can reference the global namespace.
