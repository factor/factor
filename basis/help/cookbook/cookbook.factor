"The following is a simple snippet of Factor code:"
{ $example "10 sq 5 - ." "95" }
"You can click on it to evaluate it in the listener, and it will print the same output value as indicated above."
$nl
"Factor has a very simple syntax. Your program consists of " { $emphasis "words" } " and " { $emphasis "literals" } ". In the above snippet, the words are " { $link sq } ", " { $link - } " and " { $link . } ". The two integers 10 and 5 are literals."
$nl
"Factor evaluates code left to right, and stores intermediate values on a " { $emphasis "stack" } ". If you think of the stack as a pile of papers, then " { $emphasis "pushing" } " a value on the stack corresponds to placing a piece of paper at the top of the pile, while " { $emphasis "popping" } " a value corresponds to removing the topmost piece."
$nl
"All words have a " { $emphasis "stack effect declaration" } ", for example " { $snippet "( x y -- z )" } " denotes that a word takes two inputs, with " { $snippet "y" } " at the top of the stack, and returns one output. Stack effect declarations can be viewed by browsing source code, or using tools such as " { $link see } "; they are also checked by the compiler. See " { $link "effects" } "."
$nl
"Coming back to the example in the beginning of this article, the following series of steps occurs as the code is evaluated:"
{ $table
    { "Action" "Stack contents" }
    { "10 is pushed on the stack." { $snippet "10" } }
    { { "The " { $link sq } " word is executed. It pops one input from the stack - the integer 10 - and squares it, pushing the result." } { $snippet "100" } }
    { { "5 is pushed on the stack." } { $snippet "100 5" } }
    { { "The " { $link - } " word is executed. It pops two inputs from the stack - the integers 100 and 5 - and subtracts 5 from 100, pushing the result." } { $snippet "95" } }
    { { "The " { $link . } " word is executed. It pops one input from the stack - the integer 95 - and prints it in the listener's output area." } { } }

"The " { $link sq } " word is actually defined as follows:"
{ $code ": sq ( x -- y ) dup * ;" }
"(You could have looked this up yourself by clicking on the " { $link sq } " word itself.)"
$nl
"Note the key elements in a word definition: The colon " { $link POSTPONE: : } " denotes the start of a word definition. The name of the new word and a stack effect declaration must immediately follow. The word definition then continues on until the " { $link POSTPONE: ; } " token signifies the end of the definition. This type of word definition is called a " { $emphasis "compound definition." }
$nl
"Factor is all about code reuse through short and logical colon definitions. Breaking up a problem into small pieces which are easy to test is called " { $emphasis "factoring." }
$nl
"Another example of a colon definition:"
{ $code ": neg ( x -- -x ) 0 swap - ;" }
"Here the " { $link swap } " shuffle word is used to interchange the top two stack elements. Note the difference that " { $link swap } " makes in the following two snippets:"
{ $code
    "5 0 -       ! Computes 5-0"
    "5 0 swap -  ! Computes 0-5"

ARTICLE: "cookbook-philosophy" "Factor philosophy"
"Learning a stack language is like learning to ride a bicycle: it takes a bit of practice and you might graze your knees a couple of times, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature."
$nl
"The most common difficulty encountered by beginners is trouble reading and writing code as a result of trying to place too many values on the stack at a time."
$nl
"Keep the following guidelines in mind to avoid losing your sense of balance:"
{ $list
    "Simplify, simplify, simplify. Break your program up into small words which operate on a few values at a time. Most word definitions should fit on a single line; very rarely should they exceed two or three lines."
    "In addition to keeping your words short, keep them meaningful. Give them good names, and make sure each word only does one thing. Try documenting your words; if the documentation for a word is unclear or complex, chances are the word definition is too. Don't be afraid to refactor your code."
    "If your code looks repetitive, factor it some more."
    "If after factoring, your code still looks repetitive, introduce combinators."
    "If after introducing combinators, your code still looks repetitive, look into using meta-programming techniques."
    "Try to place items on the stack in the order in which they are needed. If everything is in the correct order, no shuffling needs to be performed."
    "If you find yourself writing a stack comment in the middle of a word, break the word up."
    { "Use " { $link "cleave-combinators" } " and " { $link "spread-combinators" } " instead of " { $link "shuffle-words" } " to give your code more structure." }
    { "Not everything has to go on the stack. The " { $vocab-link "namespaces" } " vocabulary provides dynamically-scoped variables, and the " { $vocab-link "locals" } " vocabulary provides lexically-scoped variables. Learn both and use them where they make sense, but keep in mind that overuse of variables makes code harder to factor." }
    "Every time you define a word which simply manipulates sequences, hashtables or objects in an abstract way which is not related to your program domain, check the library to see if you can reuse an existing definition."
    { "Write unit tests. Factor provides good support for unit testing; see " { $link "tools.test" } ". Once your program has a good test suite you can refactor with confidence and catch regressions early." }
    "Don't write Factor as if it were C. Imperative programming and indexed loops are almost always not the most idiomatic solution."
    { "Use sequences, assocs and objects to group related data. Object allocation is very cheap. Don't be afraid to create tuples, pairs and triples. Don't be afraid of operations which allocate new objects either, such as " { $link append } "." }
    { "If you find yourself writing a loop with a sequence and an index, there's almost always a better way. Learn the " { $link "sequences-combinators" } " by heart." }
    { "If you find yourself writing a heavily nested loop which performs several steps on each iteration, there is almost always a better way. Break the problem down into a series of passes over the data instead, gradually transforming it into the desired result with a series of simple loops. Factor the loops out and reuse them. If you're working on anything math-related, learn " { $link "math-vectors" } " by heart." }
    { "If you find yourself wishing you could iterate over the datastack, or capture the contents of the datastack into a sequence, or push each element of a sequence onto the datastack, there is almost always a better way. Use " { $link "sequences" } " instead." }
    "Don't use meta-programming if there's a simpler way."
    "Don't worry about efficiency unless your program is too slow. Don't prefer complex code to simple code just because you feel it will be more efficient. The Factor compiler is designed to make idiomatic code run fast."
    { "None of the above are hard-and-fast rules: there are exceptions to all of them. But one rule unconditionally holds: " { $emphasis "there is always a simpler way" } "." }
}
"Factor tries to implement as much of itself as possible, because this improves simplicity and performance. One consequence is that Factor exposes its internals for extension and study. You even have the option of using low-level features not usually found in high-level languages, such as manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and inline assembly code."
$nl
"Unsafe features are tucked away so that you will not invoke them by accident, or have to use them to solve conventional programming problems. However when the need arises, unsafe features are invaluable, for example you might have to do some pointer arithmetic when interfacing directly with C libraries." ;

ARTICLE: "cookbook-pitfalls" "Pitfalls to avoid"

    "Factor does not hide anything from the programmer, all internals are exposed. It is your responsibility to avoid writing fragile code which depends too much on implementation detail."
    { "If a literal object appears in a word definition, the object itself is pushed on the stack when the word executes, not a copy. If you intend to mutate this object, you must " { $link clone } " it first. See " { $link "syntax-literals" } "." }
    { "Also, " { $link dup } " and related shuffle words don't copy entire objects or arrays; they only duplicate the reference to them. If you want to guard an object against mutation, use " { $link clone } "." }
    { "For a discussion of potential issues surrounding the " { $link f } " object, see " { $link "booleans" } "." }
    { "Factor's object system is quite flexible. Careless usage of union, mixin and predicate classes can lead to similar problems to those caused by “multiple inheritance” in other languages. In particular, it is possible to have two classes such that they have a non-empty intersection and yet neither is a subclass of the other. If a generic word defines methods on two such classes, various disambiguation rules are applied to ensure method dispatch remains deterministic, however they may not be what you expect. See " { $link "method-order" } " for details." }
    { "Be careful when calling words which access variables from a " { $link make-assoc } " which constructs an assoc with arbitrary keys, since those keys might shadow variables." }
    { "If " { $link run-file } " throws a stack depth assertion, it means that the top-level form in the file left behind values on the stack. The stack depth is compared before and after loading a source file, since this type of situation is almost always an error. If you have a legitimate need to load a source file which returns data in some manner, define a word in the source file which produces this data on the stack and call the word after loading the file." }
