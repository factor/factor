ARTICLE: "classes.struct" "Struct classes"
{ $link struct } " classes are similar to " { $link tuple } "s, but their slots exhibit value semantics, and they are backed by a contiguous structured block of memory. Structs can be used for structured access to C memory or Factor byte arrays and for passing struct values in and out of the FFI. Struct types are defined using a syntax similar to tuple syntax:"
{ $subsection POSTPONE: STRUCT: }
"Structs can be allocated with " { $link new } "- and " { $link boa } "-like constructor words. Additional words are provided for building structs from C memory and from existing buffers:"
{ $subsection <struct> }
{ $subsection <struct-boa> }
{ $subsection malloc-struct }
{ $subsection memory>struct }
"When the contents of a struct will be immediately reset, faster primitive words are available that will create a struct without initializing its contents:"
{ $subsection (struct) }
{ $subsection (malloc-struct) }
"Structs have literal syntax like tuples:"
{ $subsection POSTPONE: S{ }
"Union structs are also supported, which behave like structs but share the same memory for all the type's slots."
