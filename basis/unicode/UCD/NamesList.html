<h2>1.0 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Unicode name list file NamesList.txt (also NamesList.lst) is a plain
text file used to drive the layout of the character code charts in the Unicode
Standard. The information in this file is a combination of several fields from
the UnicodeData.txt and Blocks.txt files, together with additional annotations
for many characters.</p>
<p>This document describes the syntax rules for the file 
format, but also gives brief information on how each construct is rendered
when laid out for the code charts. Some of the syntax elements are used only in
preparation of the drafts of the code charts and are not present in the final,
released form of the NamesList.txt file.</p>

<p>Over time, the syntax has been extended by adding new features. The syntax for formal aliases and index tabs was introduced with Unicode
5.0. The syntax for marginal sidebar comments is utilized extensively in
draft versions of the NamesList.txt file. The support for UTF-8 encoded files and the syntax for the UTF-8 charset 
declaration in a comment at the head of the file were introduced after Unicode 
6.1.0 was published, as was the syntax for the specification of variation sequences and alternate glyphs and their respective summaries. The repertoire restriction
in comments and aliases in the names list format was loosened from the prior
limitation to U+0020..U+00FF, to include the wider range U+0020..U+02FF, as of Unicode 11.0.</p>

<p>The same input file can be used for the preparation of drafts and final editions for ISO/IEC 
  10646. Earlier versions of that standard used a different style, referred to below as ISO-style. That style necessitated the presence of some 
  information in the name list file that is not needed (and in fact removed
  during parsing) for the Unicode code charts.</p>

<p>With access to the layout program (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unibook/">Unibook</a>) it is a simple matter of 
creating name lists for the purpose of formatting working drafts or other documents containing 
proposed characters.</p>  
  <p>The content of the NamesList.txt file is optimized for code chart creation. 
  Some information that can be inferred by the reader from context has been 
  suppressed to make the code charts more readable. See the chapter on Code 
	Charts in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest">Unicode 
	Standard</a>.</p> 

<h3>1.1 <a name="Overview" href="#Overview">NamesList File Overview</a></h3>

<p>The NamesList files are plain text files which in their most simple form look 
like this:</p>

<p>@@&lt;tab&gt;0020&lt;tab&gt;BASIC LATIN&lt;tab&gt;007F<br>
; this is a file comment (ignored)<br>
0020&lt;tab&gt;SPACE<br>
0021&lt;tab&gt;EXCLAMATION MARK<br>
0022&lt;tab&gt;QUOTATION MARK<br>
. . . <br>
007F&lt;tab&gt;DELETE</p>

<p>The semicolon (as first character), @ and &lt;tab&gt; characters are used
by the file syntax and must be provided as shown. Hexadecimal digits must be 
in UPPERCASE. A double @@ introduces a block header, with the title, and 
start and ending code of the block provided as shown.</p>

<p>For a minimal name list, only the NAME_LINE and BLOCKHEADER and 
their constituent syntax elements are needed.</p>

<p>The full syntax with all the options is provided in the following sections.</p>

<h2>2.0 <a name="FileStructure" href="#FileStructure">NamesList File Structure</a></h2>

<p>This section defines the overall file structure</p>

<pre><strong>NAMELIST:     TITLE_PAGE* EXTENDED_BLOCK*
</strong>
<strong>TITLE_PAGE:   TITLE 
		| TITLE_PAGE SUBTITLE 
		| TITLE_PAGE SUBHEADER 
		| TITLE_PAGE IGNORED_LINE 
		| TITLE_PAGE EMPTY_LINE
		| TITLE_PAGE NOTICE_LINE
		| TITLE_PAGE COMMENT_LINE
		| TITLE_PAGE PAGEBREAK 
		| TITLE_PAGE FILE_COMMENT 
		| FILE_COMMENT


EXTENDED_BLOCK:	BLOCK 
		| BLOCK SUMMARY


BLOCK:	BLOCKHEADER 
		| BLOCKHEADER INDEX_TAB
		| BLOCK CHAR_ENTRY 
		| BLOCK SUBHEADER 
		| BLOCK NOTICE_LINE 
		| BLOCK EMPTY_LINE 
		| BLOCK IGNORED_LINE
		| BLOCK SIDEBAR_LINE
		| BLOCK PAGEBREAK
		| BLOCK FILE_COMMENT
		| BLOCK CROSS_REF


CHAR_ENTRY:   NAME_LINE | RESERVED_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY ALIAS_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY FORMALALIAS_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY COMMENT_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY CROSS_REF
		| CHAR_ENTRY DECOMPOSITION
		| CHAR_ENTRY COMPAT_MAPPING
		| CHAR_ENTRY IGNORED_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY EMPTY_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY NOTICE_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY FILE_COMMENT 
		| CHAR_ENTRY VARIATION_LINE
</strong></pre>

<p>In other words:</p>
<p> 
  Neither TITLE nor SUBTITLE may occur after the first BLOCKHEADER. </p>
<p>Only TITLE, SUBTITLE, SUBHEADER, PAGEBREAK, COMMENT_LINE, NOTICE_LINE, 
    EMPTY_LINE, IGNORED_LINE and FILE_COMMENT may occur before the first BLOCKHEADER.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CROSS_REF, DECOMPOSITION, COMPAT_MAPPING, VARIATION_LINE, ALIAS and FORMALALIAS_LINE lines 
    occurring before the first block header are treated as if they were 
    COMMENT_LINEs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Directly following either a NAME_LINE or a RESERVED_LINE an uninterrupted 
    sequence of the following lines may occur (in any order and repeated as often
    as needed): ALIAS_LINE, CROSS_REF, DECOMPOSITION, COMPAT_MAPPING, FORMALALIAS_LINE, NOTICE_LINE, 
    EMPTY_LINE, IGNORED_LINE, VARIATION_LINE and FILE_COMMENT.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The conventional order of elements in a char entry: NAME_LINE, 
    FORMALALIAS_LINE, ALIAS, COMMENT_LINE or NOTICE_LINE, CROSS_REFs, VARIATION_LINE, and optionally 
    ending in either DECOMPOSITION or COMPAT_MAPPING is not enforced by the layout program 
    (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unibook/">Unibook</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p>Except for CROSS_REF, NOTICE_LINE, SIDEBAR_LINE, EMPTY_LINE, IGNORED_LINE and 
    FILE_COMMENT, none of these lines may 
    occur in any other place.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A NOTICE_LINE or CROSS_REF displays differently depending on whether it follows a header or title 
    or is part of a CHAR_ENTRY</li>
  </ul>
<p>A PAGEBREAK may appear anywhere, except the middle of a CHARACTER_ENTRY. 
    A PAGEBREAK before the file title lines may not be supported. INDEX_TABs may 
    appear after any block header.</p>
<p>If the first line of a file is a file comment, it may contain a UTF-8 
    charset declaration (see below). Alternatively, or in addition, a BOM may be 
    present at the very beginning of the file, forcing the encoding to be 
    interpreted as UTF-16 (little-endian only) or UTF-8. When
    declared as UTF-8, the names list format will support use of characters in
    the range U+0020..U+02FF in LINE and LABEL elements. Otherwise,
    the supported repertoire is limited to Latin-1, and attempted use of characters outside
    the Latin-1 range will result in data corruption.</p>
<p>Several of these elements, while part of the formal definition of the 
  file format, do not occur in final published versions of 
   NamesList.txt in the UCD.</p>

<h4>Blocks followed by Summaries</h4>
<p>A block may be extended by a summary of standard variation sequences or selected alternate glyphs (or both) defined for characters in the block:</p>
<pre><strong>
SUMMARY:   ALTGLYPH_SUMMARY
		| VARIATION SUMMARY
		| ALTGLYPH_SUMMARY VARIATION_SUMMARY
		| MIXED_SUMMARY

ALTGLYPH_SUMMARY:   ALTGLYPH_SUBHEADER
		| ALTGLYPH_SUMMARY SUMMARY_LINE

VARIATION_SUMMARY:   VARIATION_SUBHEADER
		| VARIATION_SUMMARY SUMMARY_LINE
				
MIXED_SUMMARY:   MIXED_SUBHEADER
		| MIXED_SUMMARY SUMMARY_LINE

SUMMARY_LINE:   SUBHEADER
		| NOTICE_LINE
		| FILE_COMMENT
		| EMPTY_LINE</strong>
</pre>

<p>When formatted for display, each summary will recap the information presented in the VARIATION_LINE elements
of the preceding block, grouped by alternate glyph variants and standardized variation sequences, and
preceded by the corresponding subheader. Additional SUBHEADER and NOTICE lines, if provided, immediately
follow the ALTGLYPH_SUBHEADER, VARIATION_SUBHEADER or MIXED_SUBHEADER. There is no provision to provide subheaders that are
interspersed between items in the summary.</p>

<p>These syntax constructs are entirely optional. If the ALTGLYPH_SUBHEADER or VARIATION_SUBHEADER are 
omitted from the names list, but the preceding block nevertheless contains VARIATION_LINE elements 
as described below, Unibook will automatically generate any required summaries using a default format for the headers.</p>

<p>Thus, the main purpose for providing ALTGLYPH_SUBHEADER or VARIATION_SUBHEADER elements would be to 
provide specific contents for these summary titles as well as allow the ability to add additional 
information via SUBHEADER and NOTICE elements. The final published version of the Unicode names list 
is machine generated and will always explicitly provide any summary subheaders.</p>

<h3>2.1 <a name="FileElements" href="#FileElements">NamesList File Elements</a></h3>

	<b>Notes:</b><ul>
	<li>Blocks must be aligned on 16-code point boundary and contain an integer 
		multiple of 16-code point columns. The exception to that rule is for blocks of
		ideographs, <i>etc.</i>, for which no names are listed in the file. The BLOCKEND for such blocks 
	        must correspond to the last assigned character, and not the actual end of the block.</li>
	<li>Blocks must be non-overlapping and in ascending order. NAME_LINEs 
		must be in ascending order and follow the block header for the block to 
		which they belong. </li>
	<li>Reserved entries are optional, and will normally be supplied automatically. They are 
		required whenever followed by ALIAS_LINE, COMMENT_LINE, NOTICE_LINE or CROSS_REF.
	</li>
<li>An empty alternative glyph summary subheader expression will result in default header &quot;Selected Alternative Glyphs&quot;</li>
<li>An empty standard variation subheader expression will result in the default header &quot;Standardized Variation Sequences&quot;</li>
<li> A VARSEL_LIST may only contain code points for standard variation selectors (including script specific ones)</li>
<li>When displaying a VARIATION_LINE for alternate glyphs, the &quot;ALTn&quot; selector is not displayed. </li>
<li>If a glyph is unavailable for the variant glyph in a VARIATION_LINE it is replaced by the glyph for LIGHT SCREEN.</li>

</pre>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
       <li>Multiple or leading spaces, multiple or leading hyphens, as well as 
       word-initial digits in NAMEs or LCNAMEs are illegal.</li>
	<li>The French version of the names list uses French rules, which allow 
		apostrophe and accented letters in character names.</li>
       <li>When names containing code points are lowercased to make them LCNAMEs, 
         the code point values remain uppercase. Such code points by convention 
         follow a hyphen and are the last element in the name.</li>
       <li>Special lookahead logic prevents a 4 digit number for a standard, such 
       as ISO 9999 from being misinterpreted as ISO CHAR. Currently recognized are 
       &quot;ISO&quot;, &quot;DIN&quot;, &quot;IEC&quot; and &quot;S X&quot; as well as &quot;S C&quot; for the JIS X and JIS C series of 
       standards. For other standards, or for four-digit years in a comment, use a 
       NOTICE_LINE instead, which prevents expansion, or use '\&quot; to escape the digits.</li>
       <li>Single and double straight quotes in an EXPAND_LINE are replaced by curly quotes using English rules.
    Smart apostrophes are supported, but nested quotes are not.
       Single quotes can only be applied around a single word.</li>
       <li>A CHAR inside ' or &quot; is expanded, but only its glyph image is printed, the
    code value is not echoed.</li>
       <li>Inside an EXPAND_LINE, backslash is treated as an escape character that
       removes the special meaning of any literal character and also prevents
       the following digit sequence from being expanded. A backslash character in
       isolation is never displayed. A sequence of two backslash characters results
       in display of a single backslash, but has no effect on the interpretation
       of following characters.</li>
       <li>The hyphen in a character range CHAR-CHAR is replaced by an EN DASH on 
       output.</li>
       <li>The NamesList.txt file is encoded in UTF-8 if the <i>first line</i> is a 
       FILE_COMMENT containing the declaration &quot;UTF-8&quot; or any casemap variation 
       thereof. Otherwise the file is encoded in Latin-1 (older versions). Beyond 
       detecting the charset declaration (typically: &quot;; charset=utf-8&quot;) the 
       remainder of that comment is ignored. 
       If the file is not encoded as 
       UTF-8, the character repertoire for running text (anything
       other than CHAR) is effectively restricted to the repertoire of Latin-1.
       Otherwise, characters in the range U+0020..U+02FF
       	are allowed in STRING or LABEL elements, and elements derived from them.</li>
       <li>The code chart layout program
       (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unibook/">Unibook</a>)
       can accept files in several other formats. These include little-endian UTF-16,
       prefixed with a BOM, or UTF-8 prefixed with the UTF-8 BOM.</li>
       <li>While the format allows multiple &lt;tab&gt; characters, by convention the 
       actual number of tabs is always one or two, chosen to provide the best 
       layout of the plain text file.</li>
       <li>Earlier published versions of the NamesList.txt file may contain trailing or otherwise extraneous 
       spaces or tab characters; while these are errors in the files, they are not
