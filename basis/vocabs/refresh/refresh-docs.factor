"With the help of the " { $vocab-link "io.monitors" } " vocabulary, loaded source files across all vocabulary roots are monitored for changes on disk."

"If a change to a source file is detected, the next invocation of " { $link refresh-all } " will compare the file's checksum against its previous value, reloading the file if necessary. This takes advantage of the fact that the " { $vocab-link "source-files" } " vocabulary records CRC32 checksums of source files that have been parsed by " { $link "parser" } "."
