ARTICLE: "listener" "The listener"
"The listener evaluates Factor expressions read from the input stream. Typically, you write Factor code in a text editor, load it from the listener by calling " { $link require } ", " { $link reload } " or " { $link run-file } ", and then test it from interactively."

"The classical first program can be run in the listener:"
{ $example "\"Hello, world\" print" "Hello, world" }
"New words can also be defined in the listener:"
{ $example
    "USE: math.functions"
    ": twice ( word -- ) [ execute ] [ execute ] bi ; inline"
    "81 \\ sqrt twice ."
    "3.0"
}
"Multi-line expressions are supported:"
{ $example "{ 1 2 3 } [\n    .\n] each" "1\n2\n3" }
"The listener will display the current contents of the datastack after every line of input."

{ $subsections "listener-watch" }
"Nested listeners can be useful for testing code in other dynamic scopes. For example, when doing database maintanance using the " { $vocab-link "db.tuples" } " vocabulary, it can be useful to start a listener with a database connection:"
