ARTICLE: "eval-vocabs" "Evaluating strings with a different vocabulary search path"
"Strings passed to " { $link eval } " are always evaluated with an initial vocabulary search path consisting of just the " { $snippet "syntax" } " vocabulary. This is the same search path that source files start out with. This behavior can be customized by taking advantage of the fact that " { $link eval } " is composed from two simpler words:"
{ $subsections
    (eval)
    with-file-vocabs
}
"Code in the listener tool starts out with a different initial search path, with more vocabularies are available by default. Strings of code can be evaluated in this search path by using " { $link (eval) } " with a different combinator:"
{ $subsections
    with-interactive-vocabs
}
"When using " { $link (eval) } ", the quotation passed to " { $link with-file-vocabs } " and " { $link with-interactive-vocabs } " can also make specific vocabularies available to the evaluated string. This is done by having the quotation change the run-time vocabulary search path prior to calling " { $link (eval) } ". For run-time analogues of the parse-time " { $link "word-search-syntax" } " see " { $link "word-search-parsing" } "."
$nl
"The vocabulary set used by " { $link with-interactive-vocabs } " can be altered by rebinding a dynamic variable:"
{ $subsections interactive-vocabs }
{ $heading "Example" }
"In this example, a string is evaluated with a fictional " { $snippet "cad.objects" } " vocabulary in the search path by default, together with the listener's " { $link interactive-vocabs } "; the quotation is expected to produce a sequence on the stack:"
{ $code
    """USING: eval listener vocabs.parser ;
[
    "cad-objects" use-vocab
    (( -- seq )) (eval)
] with-interactive-vocabs"""
}
"Note that the search path in the outer code (set by the " { $link POSTPONE: USING: } " form) has no relation to the search path used when parsing the string parameter (this is determined by " { $link with-interactive-vocabs } " and " { $link use-vocab } ")." ;
