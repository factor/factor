{ $description "Creates a bitreader object, reading from the given bytearray, which counts the LSB as bit position 0. The cursor is placed at the start of the array. Note that this does not affect the order in which read bits are returned, only the order in which the cursor visits them." } ;

{ $description "Reads the next n bits ahead of the cursor, and then moves the cursor on by n bits. To read bits without moving the cursor, use " { $link peek } ". This word shadows the read word in the " { $vocab-link "io" } " vocabulary, so you may need to alias it if you are using file IO as well as bitstreams." } ;
