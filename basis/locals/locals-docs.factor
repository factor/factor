"Certain data type literals are permitted to contain local variables. Any such literals are rewritten into code which constructs an instance of the type with the values of the variables spliced in. Conceptually, this is similar to the transformation applied to quotations containing free variables."

    { $link "vectors" }
    { $link "tuples" }

"One exception to the above rule is that array instances containing free local variables (that is, immutable local variables not referenced in a closure) do retain identity. This allows macros such as " { $link cond } " to recognize that the array is constant and expand at compile time." ;

ARTICLE: "locals-mutable" "Mutable locals"
"In the list of bindings supplied to " { $link POSTPONE: :: } ", " { $link POSTPONE: [let } ", " { $link POSTPONE: [let* } " or " { $link POSTPONE: [| } ", a mutable binding may be introduced by suffixing its named with " { $snippet "!" } ". Mutable bindings are read by giving their name as usual; the suffix is not part of the binding's name. To write to a mutable binding, use the binding's name with the " { $snippet "!" } " suffix."
$nl
"Mutable bindings are implemented in a manner similar to the ML language; each mutable binding is actually an immutable binding of a mutable cell (in Factor's case, a 1-element array); reading the binding automatically dereferences the array, and writing to the binding stores into the array."
$nl
"Writing to mutable locals in outer scopes is fully supported and has the expected semantics. See " { $link "locals-examples" } " for examples of mutable local variables in action." ;

ARTICLE: "locals-fry" "Locals and fry"
"Locals integrate with " { $link "fry" } " so that mixing locals with fried quotations gives intuitive results."
$nl
"The following two code snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "'[ sq _ + ]" }
{ $code "[ [ sq ] dip + ] curry" }
"The semantics of " { $link dip } " and " { $link curry } " are such that the first example behaves as if the top of the stack as “inserted” in the “hole” in the quotation's second element."
$nl
"Conceptually, " { $link curry } " is defined so that the following two code snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "3 [ - ] curry" }
{ $code "[ 3 - ]" }
"When quotations take named parameters using " { $link POSTPONE: [| } ", " { $link curry } " fills in the variable bindings from right to left. The following two snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "3 [| a b | a b - ] curry" }
{ $code "[| a | a 3 - ]" }
"Because of this, the behavior of " { $snippet "fry" } " changes when applied to such a quotation to ensure that fry conceptually behaves the same as with normal quotations, placing the fried values “underneath” the local variable bindings. Thus, the following snippets are no longer equivalent:"
{ $code "'[ [| a | _ a - ] ]" }
{ $code "'[ [| a | a - ] curry ] call" }
"Instead, the first line above expands into something like the following:"
{ $code "[ [ swap [| a | a - ] ] curry call ]" }
$nl
"The precise behavior is as follows. When frying a " { $link POSTPONE: [| } " quotation, a stack shuffle (" { $link mnswap } ") is prepended so that the " { $snippet "m" } " curried values, which start off at the top of the stack, are transposed with the quotation's " { $snippet "n" } " named input bindings." ;

ARTICLE: "locals-limitations" "Limitations of locals"
"There are two main limitations of the current locals implementation, and both concern macros."
{ $heading "Macro expansions with free variables" }
"The expansion of a macro cannot reference local variables bound in the outer scope. For example, the following macro is invalid:"
{ $code "MACRO:: twice ( quot -- ) [ quot call quot call ] ;" }
"The following is fine, though:"
{ $code "MACRO:: twice ( quot -- ) quot quot '[ @ @ ] ;" }
{ $heading "Static stack effect inference and macros" }
"A macro will only expand at compile-time if all inputs to the macro are literal. Likewise, the word containing the macro will only get a static stack effect and compile successfully if the macro's inputs are literal. When locals are used in a macro's literal arguments, there is an additional restriction: The literals must immediately precede the macro call lexically."
$nl
"For example, all of the following three code snippets are superficially equivalent, but only the first will compile:"
{ $code
    ":: good-cond-usage ( a -- ... )"
    "    {"
    "        { [ a 0 < ] [ ... ] }"
    "        { [ a 0 > ] [ ... ] }"
    "        { [ a 0 = ] [ ... ] }"
    "    } cond ;"
}
"The next two snippets will not compile, because the argument to " { $link cond } " does not immediately precede the call to " { $link cond } ":"
{ $code
    ": my-cond ( alist -- ) cond ; inline"
    ""
    ":: bad-cond-usage ( a -- ... )"

    "        { [ a 0 = ] [ ... ] }"
    "    } swap swap cond ;"
}
"The reason is that locals are rewritten into stack code at parse time, whereas macro expansion is performed later during compile time. To circumvent this problem, the " { $vocab-link "macros.expander" } " vocabulary is used to rewrite simple macro usages prior to local transformation.
