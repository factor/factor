"Certain data type literals are permitted to contain lexical variables. Any such literals are rewritten into code which constructs an instance of the type with the values of the variables spliced in.

"One exception to the above rule is that array instances containing free lexical variables (that is, immutable lexical variables not referenced in a closure) do retain identity.

ARTICLE: "locals-mutable" "Mutable lexical variables"
"When a lexical variable is bound using " { $link POSTPONE: :> } ", " { $link POSTPONE: :: } ", or " { $link POSTPONE: [| } ", the variable may be made mutable by suffixing its name with an exclamation point (" { $snippet "!" } "). A mutable variable's value is read by giving its name without the exclamation point as usual. To write to the variable, use its name with the " { $snippet "!" } " suffix."
$nl
"Mutable bindings are implemented in a manner similar to that taken by the ML language. Each mutable binding is actually an immutable binding of a mutable cell. Reading the binding automatically unboxes the value from the cell, and writing to the binding stores into it."
$nl
"Writing to mutable variables from outer lexical scopes is fully supported and has full closure semantics. See " { $link "locals-examples" } " for examples of mutable lexical variables in action." ;

ARTICLE: "locals-fry" "Lexical variables and fry"
"Lexical variables integrate with " { $link "fry" } " so that mixing variables with fried quotations gives intuitive results."
$nl
"The following two code snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "'[ sq _ + ]" }
{ $code "[ [ sq ] dip + ] curry" }
"The semantics of " { $link dip } " and " { $link curry } " are such that the first example behaves as if the top of the stack as “inserted” in the “hole” in the quotation's second element."
$nl
"Conceptually, " { $link curry } " is defined so that the following two code snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "3 [ - ] curry" }
{ $code "[ 3 - ]" }
"When quotations take named parameters using " { $link POSTPONE: [| } ", " { $link curry } " fills in the variable bindings from right to left. The following two snippets are equivalent:"
{ $code "3 [| a b | a b - ] curry" }
{ $code "[| a | a 3 - ]" }
"Because of this, the behavior of " { $snippet "fry" } " changes when applied to such a quotation to ensure that fry conceptually behaves the same as with normal quotations, placing the fried values “underneath” the variable bindings. Thus, the following snippets are no longer equivalent:"
{ $code "'[ [| a | _ a - ] ]" }
{ $code "'[ [| a | a - ] curry ] call" }
"Instead, the first line above expands into something like the following:"
{ $code "[ [ swap [| a | a - ] ] curry call ]" }
$nl
"The precise behavior is as follows. When frying a " { $link POSTPONE: [| } " quotation, a stack shuffle (" { $link mnswap } ") is prepended so that the " { $snippet "m" } " curried values, which start off at the top of the stack, are transposed with the quotation's " { $snippet "n" } " named input bindings." ;

ARTICLE: "locals-limitations" "Limitations of lexical variables"
"There are two main limitations of the current implementation, and both concern macros."
{ $heading "Macro expansions with free variables" }

"The following is fine, though:"
{ $code "MACRO:: twice ( quot -- ) quot quot '[ @ @ ] ;" }
{ $heading "Static stack effect inference and macros" }
"A macro will only expand at compile-time if all of its inputs are literal. Likewise, the word containing the macro will only have a static stack effect and compile successfully if the macro's inputs are literal. When lexical variables are used in a macro's literal arguments, there is an additional restriction: The literals must immediately precede the macro call lexically."
$nl
"For example, all of the following three code snippets are superficially equivalent, but only the first will compile:"
{ $code
    ":: good-cond-usage ( a -- ... )"

    "        { [ a 0 < ] [ ... ] }"
    "        { [ a 0 > ] [ ... ] }"
    "        { [ a 0 = ] [ ... ] }"
    "    } cond ;"
}
"The next two snippets will not compile because the argument to " { $link cond } " does not immediately precede the call:"
{ $code

    ""
    ":: bad-cond-usage ( a -- ... )"

    "        { [ a 0 = ] [ ... ] }"
    "    } swap swap cond ;"
}
"The reason is that lexical variable references are rewritten into stack code at parse time, whereas macro expansion is performed later during compile time. To circumvent this problem, the " { $vocab-link "macros.expander" } " vocabulary is used to rewrite simple macro usages prior to lexical variable transformation.
