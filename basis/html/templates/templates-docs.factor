"The master/child template interface follows a pattern where for each concept there is a word called by the child to store an entity, and another word to write the entity out; this solves the problem where certain HTML tags, such as " { $snippet "<title>" } " and " { $snippet "<link>" } " must appear inside the " { $snippet "<head>" } " tag, even though those tags are usually precisely those that the child template will want to set."
