ARTICLE: "persistent.vectors" "Persistent vectors"
"A " { $emphasis "persistent vector" } " differs from an ordinary vector (" { $link "vectors" } ") in that it is immutable, and all operations yield new persistent vectors instead of modifying inputs. Unlike immutable operations on ordinary sequences, persistent vector operations are efficient and run in sub-linear time."
