ARTICLE: "http.server.rewrite.overview" "Rewrite responder overview"
"Rewrite responders take the file name and turn it into a request parameter named by the " { $slot "param" } " slot before delegating to a child responder. If a file name is provided, it calls the responder in the " { $slot "child" } " slot. If no file name is provided, they call the default responder in the " { $slot "default" } " slot."

"For example, suppose you want to have the following website schema:"
{ $list
{ { $snippet "/posts/" } " - show a list of posts" }
{ { $snippet "/posts/factor_language" } " - show thread with ID " { $snippet "factor_language" } }
{ { $snippet "/posts/factor_language/1" } " - show first comment in the thread with ID " { $snippet "factor_language" } }
{ { $snippet "/animals" } ", ... - a bunch of other actions" } }
"One way to achieve this would be to have a nesting of responders as follows:"
{ $list
{ "A dispatcher at the top level" }
  { "A " { $link rewrite } " as a child of the dispatcher under the name " { $snippet "posts" } ". The rewrite has the " { $slot "param" } " slot set to, say, " { $snippet "post_id" } ". The " { $slot "default" } " slot is set to a Furnace action which displays a list of posts." }
  { "The child slot is set to a second " { $link rewrite } " instance, with " { $snippet "param" } " set to " { $snippet "comment_id" } ", the " { $slot "default" } " slot set to an action which displays a post identified by the " { $snippet "post_id" } " parameter, and the " { $snippet "child" } " slot set to an action which displays the comment identified by the " { $snippet "comment_id" } " parameter." } }
"Note that parameters can be extracted from the request using the " { $link param } " word, but most of the time you want to use " { $vocab-link "furnace.actions" } " instead." ;
