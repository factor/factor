ARTICLE: "concurrency.locks.rw" "Read-write locks"
"A read-write lock encapsulates a common pattern in the implementation of concurrent data structures, where one wishes to ensure that a thread is able to see a consistent view of the structure for a period of time, during which no other thread modifies the structure."
$nl
"While this can be achieved with a simple " { $link "concurrency.locks.mutex" } ", performance will suffer, since in fact multiple threads can view the structure at the same time; serialization must only be enforced for writes."
$nl
"Read/write locks allow any number of threads to hold the read lock simulateneously, however attempting to acquire a write lock blocks until all other threads release read locks and write locks."
$nl
"Read/write locks are reentrant. A thread holding a write lock may acquire a read lock or a write lock without blocking. However a thread holding a read lock may not acquire a write lock recursively since that could break invariants assumed by the code executing with the read lock held."
