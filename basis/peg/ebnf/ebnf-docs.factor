ARTICLE: "peg.ebnf.tokenizers" "Tokenizers"
"It is possible to override the tokenizer in an EBNF defined parser. "
"Usually the input sequence to be parsed is an array of characters or a string. "
"Terminals in a rule match successive characters in the array or string. "
{ $examples
    { $code
        "EBNF: foo"
        "rule = \"++\" \"--\""
        ";EBNF"
    }
}
"This parser when run with the string \"++--\" or the array "
"{ CHAR: + CHAR: + CHAR: - CHAR: - } will succeed with an AST of { \"++\" \"--\" }. "
"If you want to add whitespace handling to the grammar you need to put it "
"between the terminals: "
{ $examples
    { $code
        "EBNF: foo"
        "space = (\" \" | \"\\r\" | \"\\t\" | \"\\n\")"
        "spaces = space* => [[ drop ignore ]]"
        "rule = spaces \"++\" spaces \"--\" spaces"
        ";EBNF"
    }
}
"In a large grammar this gets tedious and makes the grammar hard to read. "
"Instead you can write a rule to split the input sequence into tokens, and "
"have the grammar operate on these tokens. This is how the previous example "
"might look: "
{ $examples
    { $code
        "EBNF: foo"
        "space = (\" \" | \"\\r\" | \"\\t\" | \"\\n\")"
        "spaces = space* => [[ drop ignore ]]"
        "tokenizer = spaces ( \"++\" | \"--\" )"
        "rule = \"++\" \"--\""
        ";EBNF"
     }
}
"'tokenizer' is the name of a built in rule. Once defined it is called to "
"retrieve the next complete token from the input sequence. So the first part "
"of 'rule' is to try and match \"++\". It calls the tokenizer to get the next "
"complete token. This ignores spaces until it finds a \"++\" or \"--\". "
"It is as if the input sequence for the parser was actually { \"++\" \"--\" } "
"instead of the string \"++--\". With the new tokenizer \"....\" sequences "
"in the grammar are matched for equality against the token, rather than a "
"string comparison against successive items in the sequence. This can be used "
"to match an AST from a tokenizer. "
$nl
"In this example I split the tokenizer into a separate parser and use "
"'foreign' to call it from the main one. This allows testing of the "
"tokenizer separately: "

"The '.' EBNF production means match a single object in the source sequence. "
"Usually this is a character. With the replacement tokenizer it is either a "
"number object, a string object or a string containing the operator. "
"Using a tokenizer in language grammars makes it easier to deal with whitespace. "
"Defining tokenizers in this way has the advantage of the tokenizer and parser "
"working in one pass. There is no tokenization occurring over the whole string "
"followed by the parse of that result. It tokenizes as it needs to. You can even "
"switch tokenizers multiple times during a grammar. Rules use the tokenizer that "
"was defined lexically before the rule. This is usefull in the JavaScript grammar: "
{ $examples
    { $code
        "EBNF: javascript"
        "tokenizer         = default"
        "nl                = \"\\r\" \"\\n\" | \"\\n\""
        "tokenizer         = <foreign tokenize-javascript Tok>"
        "..."
        "End                = !(.)"
        "Name               = . ?[ ast-name?   ]?   => [[ value>> ]] "
        "Number             = . ?[ ast-number? ]?   => [[ value>> ]]"

        "SpacesNoNl         = (!(nl) Space)* => [[ ignore ]]"
        "Sc                 = SpacesNoNl (nl | &(\"}\") | End)| \";\""
    }
}
"Here the rule 'nl' is defined using the default tokenizer of sequential "
"characters ('default' has the special meaning of the built in tokenizer). "
"This is followed by using the JavaScript tokenizer for the remaining rules. "
"This tokenizer strips out whitespace and newlines. Some rules in the grammar "
"require checking for a newline. In particular the automatic semicolon insertion "
"rule (managed by the 'Sc' rule here). If there is a newline, the semicolon can "
"be optional in places. "
{ $examples
    { $code
      "\"do\" Stmt:s \"while\" \"(\" Expr:c \")\" Sc    => [[ s c ast-do-while boa ]]"
    }
}
"Even though the JavaScript tokenizer has removed the newlines, the 'nl' rule can "
"be used to detect them since it is using the default tokenizer. This allows "
"grammars to mix and match the tokenizer as required to make them more readable."
