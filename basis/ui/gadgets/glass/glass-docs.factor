"The " { $vocab-link "ui.gadgets.glass" } " vocabulary implements support for displaying gadgets in the glass layer of a window. The gadget can be positioned arbitrarily within the glass layer, and while it is visible, mouse clicks outside of the glass layer are intercepted to hide the glass layer. Multiple glass layers can be active at a time; they behave as if stacked on top of each other."
