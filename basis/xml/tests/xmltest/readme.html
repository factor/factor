<P>
The collection is structured into three directories:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>not-wf</CODE>
<DD>this contains cases that are not well-formed XML documents
<DT><CODE>valid</CODE>
<DD>this contains cases that are valid XML documents
<DT><CODE>invalid</CODE>
<DD>this contains cases that are well-formed XML documents
but are not valid XML documents
</DL>
<P>
The <CODE>not-wf</CODE> and <CODE>valid</CODE> directories each have
three subdirectories:
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>sa</CODE>
<DD>
this contains cases that are standalone (as defined in XML) and do not
have references to external general entities
<DT>
<CODE>ext-sa</CODE>
<DD>
this contains case that are standalone and have references to external
general entities
<DT>
<CODE>not-sa</CODE>
<DD>
this contains cases that are not standalone
</DL>
<P>
In each directory, files with a <CODE>.xml</CODE> extension are the
XML document test cases, and files with a <CODE>.ent</CODE> extension
are external entities referenced by the test cases.
<P>
Within the <CODE>valid</CODE> directory, each of these three
subdirectories has an <CODE>out</CODE> subdirectory which contains an
equivalent <A HREF="canonxml.html">canonical XML</A> document for each
of the cases.
<P>
<P>
Bug reports and contributions of new test cases are welcome.
