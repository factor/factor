ARTICLE: "heaps" "Heaps"
"A heap is an implementation of a " { $emphasis "priority queue" } ", which is a structure that maintains a sorted set of elements. The key property is that insertion of an arbitrary element and removal of the first element (determined by order) is performed in O(log n) time."
$nl
"Heap elements are key/value pairs and are compared using the " { $link <=> } " generic word on the first element of the pair."
