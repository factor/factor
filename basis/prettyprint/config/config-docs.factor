HELP: number-base

A value of " { $snippet "2" } " will print integers and ratios in binary with " { $link POSTPONE: BIN: } ", and " { $snippet "8" } " will print them in octal with " { $link POSTPONE: OCT: } ". A value of " { $snippet "16" } " will print all integers, ratios, and floating-point values in hexadecimal with " { $link POSTPONE: HEX: } ".
