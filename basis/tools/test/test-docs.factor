"A unit test is a piece of code which starts with known input values, then compares the output of a word with an expected output, where the expected output is defined by the word's contract."
$nl
"For example, if you were developing a word for computing symbolic derivatives, your unit tests would apply the word to certain input functions, comparing the results against the correct values. While the passing of these tests would not guarantee the algorithm is correct, it would at least ensure that what used to work keeps working, in that as soon as something breaks due to a change in another part of your program, failing tests will let you know."
