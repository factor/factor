ARTICLE: "math.vectors.simd.intro" "Introduction to SIMD support"
"Modern CPUs support a form of data-level parallelism, where arithmetic operations on fixed-size short vectors can be done on all components in parallel. This is known as single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)."
$nl
"SIMD support in the processor takes the form of instruction sets which operate on vector registers. By operating on multiple scalar values at the same time, code which operates on points, colors, and other vector data can be sped up."
$nl
"In Factor, SIMD support is exposed in the form of special-purpose SIMD " { $link "sequence-protocol" } " implementations. These are fixed-length, homogeneous sequences. They are referred to as vectors, but should not be confused with Factor's " { $link "vectors" } ", which can hold any type of object and can be resized.)."
$nl
"The words in the " { $vocab-link "math.vectors" } " vocabulary, which can be used with any sequence of numbers, are special-cased by the compiler. If the compiler can prove that only SIMD vectors are used, it expands " { $link "math-vectors" } " into " { $link "math.vectors.simd.intrinsics" } ". While in the general case, SIMD intrinsics operate on heap-allocated SIMD vectors, that too can be optimized since in many cases the compiler unbox SIMD vectors, storing them directly in registers."
$nl
"Since the only difference between ordinary code and SIMD-accelerated code is that the latter uses special fixed-length SIMD sequences, the SIMD library is very easy to use. To ensure your code compiles to use vector instructions without boxing and unboxing overhead, follow the guidelines for " { $link "math.vectors.simd.efficiency" } "."
$nl
"There should never be any reason to use " { $link "math.vectors.simd.intrinsics" } " directly, but they too have a straightforward, but lower-level, interface." ;

ARTICLE: "math.vectors.simd.support" "Supported SIMD instruction sets and operations"
"At present, the SIMD support makes use of SSE2 and a few SSE3 instructions on x86 CPUs."
$nl
"SSE3 introduces horizontal adds (summing all components of a single vector register), which is useful for computing dot products. Where available, SSE3 operations are used to speed up " { $link sum } ", " { $link v. } ", " { $link norm-sq } ", " { $link norm } ", and " { $link distance } ". If SSE3 is not available, software fallbacks are used for " { $link sum } " and related words, decreasing performance."
$nl
"On PowerPC, or older x86 chips without SSE2, software fallbacks are used for all high-level vector operations. SIMD code can run with no loss in functionality, just decreased performance."
$nl
"The primities in the " { $vocab-link "math.vectors.simd.intrinsics" } " vocabulary do not have software fallbacks, but they should not be called directly in any case." ;

ARTICLE: "math.vectors.simd.types" "SIMD vector types"
"Each SIMD vector type is named " { $snippet "scalar-count" } ", where " { $snippet "scalar" } " is a scalar C type such as " { $snippet "float" } " or " { $snippet "double" } ", and " { $snippet "count" } " is a vector dimension, such as 2, 4, or 8."

"The " { $link float-4 } " and " { $link double-2 } " types correspond to 128-bit vector registers. The " { $link float-8 } " and " { $link double-4 } " types are not directly supported in hardware, and instead unbox to a pair of 128-bit vector registers."

ARTICLE: "math.vectors.simd.efficiency" "Writing efficient SIMD code"
"Since SIMD vectors are heap-allocated objects, it is important to write code in a style which is conducive to the compiler being able to inline generic dispatch and eliminate allocation."
$nl
"If the inputs to a " { $vocab-link "math.vectors" } " word are statically known to be SIMD vectors, the call is converted into an SIMD primitive, and the output is then also known to be an SIMD vector (or scalar, depending on the operation); this information propagates forward within a single word (together with any inlined words and macro expansions). Any intermediate values which are not stored into collections, or returned from the word, are furthermore unboxed."
$nl
"To check if optimizations are being performed, pass a quotation to the " { $snippet "optimizer-report." } " and " { $snippet "optimized." } " words in the " { $vocab-link "compiler.tree.debugger" } " vocabulary, and look for calls to " { $link "math.vectors.simd.intrinsics" } " as opposed to high-level " { $link "math-vectors" } "."

"Note that using " { $link declare } " is not recommended. Safer ways of getting type information for the input parameters to a word include defining methods on a generic word (the value being dispatched upon has a statically known type in the method body), as well as using " { $link "hints" } " and " { $link POSTPONE: inline } " declarations."
