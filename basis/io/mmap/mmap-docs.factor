"The " { $link <mapped-file> } " word returns an instance of " { $link mapped-file } ", which doesn't directly support the sequence protocol. Instead, it needs to be wrapped in a specialized array of the appropriate C type:"

"Data can also be read and written from the " { $link mapped-file } " by applying low-level alien words to the " { $slot "address" } " slot. This approach is not recommended, though, since in most cases the compiler will generate efficient code for specialized array usage. See " { $link "reading-writing-memory" } " for a description of low-level memory access primitives." ;
