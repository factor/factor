"The " { $vocab-link "macros" } " vocabulary implements " { $emphasis "macros" } ", which are code transformations that may run at compile-time under the right circumstances."
$nl
"Macros can be used to implement combinators whose stack effects depend on an input parameter. Since macros are expanded at compile time, this permits the compiler to infer a static stack effect for the word calling the macro."
$nl
"Macros can also be used to calculate lookup tables and generate code at compile time, which can improve performance, raise the level of abstraction, and simplify code."
$nl
"Factor macros are similar to Lisp macros; they are not like C preprocessor macros."
$nl
"Defining new macros:"
{ $subsections POSTPONE: MACRO: }
"A slightly lower-level facility, " { $emphasis "compiler transforms" } ", allows an ordinary word definition to co-exist with a version that performs compile-time expansion. The ordinary definition is only used from code compiled with the non-optimizing compiler. Under normal circumstances, macros should be used instead of compiler transforms; compiler transforms are only used for words such as " { $link cond } " which are frequently invoked during the bootstrap process, and this having a performant non-optimized definition which does not generate code on the fly is important."
