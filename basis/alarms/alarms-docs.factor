ARTICLE: "alarms" "Alarms"
"The " { $vocab-link "alarms" } " vocabulary provides a lightweight way to schedule one-time and recurring tasks. Alarms run in a single green thread per alarm and consist of a quotation, a delay duration, and an interval duration. After starting an alarm, the alarm thread sleeps for the delay duration and calls the quotation. Then it waits out the interval duration and calls the quotation again until something stops the alarm. If a recurring alarm's quotation would be scheduled to run again before the previous quotation has finished processing, the alarm will be run again immediately afterwards. This may result in the alarm falling behind indefinitely, in which case the it will run as often as possible while still allowing other green threads to run. Recurring alarms that execute 'on time' or 'catch up' will always be scheduled for an exact multiple of the interval from the original starting time to prevent the alarm from drifting over time. Alarms use " { $link nano-count } " as the timing primitive, so they will continue to work across system clock changes." $nl
