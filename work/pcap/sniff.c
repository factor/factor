 *
 * Below is an excerpt from an email from Guy Harris on the tcpdump-workers
 * mail list when someone asked, "How do I get the length of the TCP
 * payload?" Guy Harris' slightly snipped response (edited by him to
 * speak of the IPv4 header length and TCP data offset without referring
 * to bitfield structure members) is reproduced below:
 * 
 * The Ethernet size is always 14 bytes.
 * 
 * <snip>...</snip>
 *
 * In fact, you *MUST* assume the Ethernet header is 14 bytes, *and*, if 
 * you're using structures, you must use structures where the members 
 * always have the same size on all platforms, because the sizes of the 
 * fields in Ethernet - and IP, and TCP, and... - headers are defined by 
 * the protocol specification, not by the way a particular platform's C 
 * compiler works.)
 *
 * The IP header size, in bytes, is the value of the IP header length,
 * as extracted from the "ip_vhl" field of "struct sniff_ip" with
 * the "IP_HL()" macro, times 4 ("times 4" because it's in units of
 * 4-byte words).  If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value
 * extracted with "IP_HL()" is less than 5 - you have a malformed
 * IP datagram.
 *
 * The TCP header size, in bytes, is the value of the TCP data offset,
 * as extracted from the "th_offx2" field of "struct sniff_tcp" with
 * the "TH_OFF()" macro, times 4 (for the same reason - 4-byte words).
 * If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value extracted with
 * "TH_OFF()" is less than 5 - you have a malformed TCP segment.
 *
 * So, to find the IP header in an Ethernet packet, look 14 bytes after 
 * the beginning of the packet data.  To find the TCP header, look 
 * "IP_HL(ip)*4" bytes after the beginning of the IP header.  To find the
 * TCP payload, look "TH_OFF(tcp)*4" bytes after the beginning of the TCP
 * header.
 * 
 * To find out how much payload there is:
 *
 * Take the IP *total* length field - "ip_len" in "struct sniff_ip" 
 * - and, first, check whether it's less than "IP_HL(ip)*4" (after
 * you've checked whether "IP_HL(ip)" is >= 5).  If it is, you have
 * a malformed IP datagram.
 *
 * Otherwise, subtract "IP_HL(ip)*4" from it; that gives you the length
 * of the TCP segment, including the TCP header.  If that's less than
 * "TH_OFF(tcp)*4" (after you've checked whether "TH_OFF(tcp)" is >= 5),
 * you have a malformed TCP segment.
 *
 * Otherwise, subtract "TH_OFF(tcp)*4" from it; that gives you the
 * length of the TCP payload.
 *
 * Note that you also need to make sure that you don't go past the end 
 * of the captured data in the packet - you might, for example, have a 
 * 15-byte Ethernet packet that claims to contain an IP datagram, but if 
 * it's 15 bytes, it has only one byte of Ethernet payload, which is too 
 * small for an IP header.  The length of the captured data is given in 
 * the "caplen" field in the "struct pcap_pkthdr"; it might be less than 
 * the length of the packet, if you're capturing with a snapshot length 
 * other than a value >= the maximum packet size.
 * <end of response>

 * Example compiler command-line for GCC:
 *   gcc -Wall -o sniffex sniffex.c -lpcap

 ****************************************************************************
 *
 * Code Comments
 *
 * This section contains additional information and explanations regarding
 * comments in the source code. It serves as documentaion and rationale
 * for why the code is written as it is without hindering readability, as it
 * might if it were placed along with the actual code inline. References in
 * the code appear as footnote notation (e.g. [1]).
 *
 * 1. Ethernet headers are always exactly 14 bytes, so we define this
 * explicitly with "#define". Since some compilers might pad structures to a
 * multiple of 4 bytes - some versions of GCC for ARM may do this -
 * "sizeof (struct sniff_ethernet)" isn't used.
 * 
 * 2. Check the link-layer type of the device that's being opened to make
 * sure it's Ethernet, since that's all we handle in this example. Other
 * link-layer types may have different length headers (see [1]).
 *
 * 3. This is the filter expression that tells libpcap which packets we're
 * interested in (i.e. which packets to capture). Since this source example
 * focuses on IP and TCP, we use the expression "ip", so we know we'll only
 * encounter IP packets. The capture filter syntax, along with some
 * examples, is documented in the tcpdump man page under "expression."
 * Below are a few simple examples:
 *
 * Expression			Description
 * ----------			-----------
 * ip					Capture all IP packets.
 * tcp					Capture only TCP packets.
 * tcp port 80			Capture only TCP packets with a port equal to 80.
 * ip host 10.1.2.3		Capture all IP packets to or from host 10.1.2.3.
