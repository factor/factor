- continuation support
  * sleep and pressed should work anywhere (is this too hard a requirement?)

- recursive calls shouldn't blow up the javascript stack
  * create continuation if user word is called
  ** it would be enough that call chain contained calls that have been made and only create new continuation if current word has been used before

- custom words UI
  * show popup for definition
  * action: get all as one string

- information about word categories as popup

- clickable examples for words

- number system
  * should be wrapped values
  * add support for rational numbers
  * currently acts similarly to javascript

- document architecture and some details
  * cleanup code a bit
