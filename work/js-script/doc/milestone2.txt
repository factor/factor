- sequence (protocol?)
  * Most of the assoc, sequence, and string vocabs
  * string is seq, "hello" [ 1 + ] map must work
  * subseq and <slice>, the latter is virtual and mutation affects original
  * quotations are sequences
  * ranges, 1 10 [a,b]

- immutability/mutability (e.g. dup makes shallow copy; problem for mutable objects operated with "compose" and ","
  * vectors are resizable with prefix & suffix 

- fry syntax
  *  _ and @

- SYNTAX:
  * should support forward-reading  
  * how are rest-strings accessed?   
  ** call lexer with some kind of next-word

- literalize, \, <wrapper>
  * define with fry syntax?

FIX
----
- some parsing words should not contain other definitions inside them, 
  * e.g. SYNTAX: SYNTAX: ; ; // the inner SYNTAX: should be ignored

- copy semantics are not the same as in real factor
  * should do deep copy for some things?
    ** problem with mutability curry, compose, "," if dup used to quotation
