Design decisions (that might change)
-----------------------------------------

- All words are in global vocabulary
- Word lookup by name is done when executing, not in parsing phase
  * it's easy to write functions that wait for implementation
- No stack effect declarations
  * could be useful for learning but this the might be annoying to write when playing around
  * limited screen space
