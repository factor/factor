The Factor project is maintained and mirrored at

## Talks and Presentations

Various talks and presentations that have been given are included here as
runnable vocabularies.

If you'd like to run these, you can add this directory as a ``vocab-root``
and then:

```factor
"name-of-the-talk-to-launch" run
```
